Doubling this average would give me 6mph. However, since walking and running take the same amount of time, the total time for the whole trip is dictated by the slower speed of 3mph. Therefore, to end up with an average of 6mph, I would have to run back at a speed that's faster than 6mph, because my running speed needs to make up for the slower walking speed as well.\n\nSince we're doubling the average speed, I'd need to run at a speed of 2x3mph = 6mph just to get the average we're aiming for. This is a minimum speed though; in reality, the running speed would have to be even faster than 6mph. I'd choose infinitely fast, but as this isn't an option, the next best choice is 12mph, as this allows some wiggle room to dip below that speed while still averaging 6mph over the whole trip.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"60":{"level_0":60,"index":1,"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have six horses and want to race them to see which is fastest.

Binary searching is an efficient method for finding an item from a list, in this case, the poisoned bottle of wine. The strategy involves dividing the total number of bottles into two roughly equal groups and having a prisoner sample from each group. If a prisoner becomes poisoned, then the search continues within the subgroup associated with the poisoned bottle.

Turning them all on at once might not help identify the individual controls of each switch, and could even be dangerous if left unattended. Walking into another room might give you information on which bulbs are on, but it does not confirm which switch controls which bulb. Similarly, feeling for warmth on the bulbs after turning switches on and off could be cumbersome and may not be immediate enough to establish clear connections.","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"466":{"level_0":466,"index":17,"category":"Puzzle","question":"The Poisoned Wine - A king has 1000 sweet bottles of wine, and one contains a very bitter poison.

Binary searching is the most efficient way to find the poisoned bottle, as it halves the number of possibilities with each iteration. This approach will allow the king to pinpoint the poisoned bottle within 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it would work:\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into two sets of 500. Give one set to five prisoners and the other set to the remaining five prisoners.\n2. After tasting the wine, the prisoners can signal the king using some method (e.g., a thumbs-up for good wine and thumbs-down for bad wine).\n3. The king will then compare the signals from the two groups. If both groups signal negatively, the king will know that the poison is in the bottle present in both sets (i.e., the intersection of the two groups). If one group signals positively and the other negatively, he will know the poison is in the bottles unique to that positive group.\n4. Repeat this process until the poisoned bottle is isolated, which should take no more than 24 hours.\n\nThis strategy leverages the prisoners' senses of taste and binary numbers to efficiently pinpoint the poisoned wine.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"467":{"level_0":467,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

With one pair of twins, the likelihood of them sharing a birthday is 1\/365. To reach a 50% chance, we'd need significantly more twins since the probability of two people having the same birthday increases as you add more pairs.\n\nTo calculate the required number of pairs, we can use the formula for combination: n!\/(r!(n\u2212r)!).

This approach will minimize the number of tests and maximize the chances of finding the poisoned bottle within 24 hours. The concept of binary numbers can be leveraged to efficiently organize and identify the poisoned wine. Binary searching involves dividing the items into halves and progressively eliminating one side based on comparisons, which significantly reduces the search space with each iteration. \n\nIn this case, the king should first give each prisoner two bottles of wine, ensuring each bottle is unique. This can be achieved by labeling the bottles with binary numbers, where each bottle is associated with a binary digit (0 or 1). The prisoners drink the wine, and after 24 hours, the king checks which prisoners became ill. Based on their reactions, the king can determine the binary representation of the poisoned wine. \n\nBy utilizing this approach, the number of potential bottles reduces with each iteration, eventually leading to the identification of the poisoned bottle. This method is significantly faster than simply dividing the bottles among the prisoners or having them drink randomly chosen wines. It ensures that the prisoners' reactions provide meaningful information to swiftly narrow down the search.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"527":{"level_0":527,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
