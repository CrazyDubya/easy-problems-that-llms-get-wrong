Here's how it applies:        1. **Number the Bottles:** Assign each bottle a number from 1 to 1000.        2. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.        3. **Binary Representation:** Think of each prisoner as representing a place value in a binary number (e.g., prisoner 1 is the 'ones' place, prisoner 2 is the 'twos' place, prisoner 3 is the 'fours' place, and so on, up to prisoner 10 representing 2^9).        4. **Give Wine Based on Binary:**  For each bottle, give a sip to the prisoners whose number corresponds to a '1' in the bottle's binary representation.            * Example: Bottle 5 (binary 0000000101) would be sipped by prisoners 1 and 3.        5. **Observe After 24 Hours:** The prisoners who die represent '1's in the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.            * Example: If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0001001001, which converts to decimal 585. Bottle 585 was poisoned.    * **Efficiency:** Binary search allows you to test a large number of possibilities quickly. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles in a single round. \"}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"77":{"level_0":77,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

It could be tasteless and odorless.\n\n* **Why D is correct (Binary Search):**\n\n    1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10. Convert each prisoner's number into its binary equivalent (e.g., Prisoner 1 is 001, Prisoner 2 is 010, Prisoner 3 is 011, etc.).  Think of each digit in the binary number as representing a specific group of bottles.\n\n    2. **Assigning Wine:** Each bottle of wine is also assigned a number from 1 to 1000.  Convert each bottle's number to its binary equivalent (up to 10 digits since 1000 in binary is 1111101000).  A prisoner will drink from a bottle if their corresponding binary digit is a '1'.\n\n       * **Example:** Bottle 5 (binary 0000000101) would be given to prisoners 1 and 3.\n\n    3. **Identifying the Poison:** After 24 hours, the pattern of deceased prisoners will directly translate back into the binary representation of the poisoned bottle number. \n\n       * **Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0010000101, which converts to decimal 525.

The Birthday Paradox states that you only need 23 people in a room to have a greater than 50% chance of two people sharing a birthday. \\n\\nHere's why we need to adjust that number for twins: \\n\\n* **Twins share a birthday:**  Each pair of twins guarantees a shared birthday, removing the randomness we rely on in the classic paradox. \\n\\n* **We need to exceed the 50% threshold:** With 11 pairs of twins (22 people), we're very close to the 23-person threshold of the original paradox. However, we need to exceed 50% to guarantee it.  \\n\\nTherefore, with 12 pairs of twins (24 people), we guarantee a shared birthday and exceed the probability threshold of the Birthday Paradox.\"}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"324":{"level_0":324,"index":25,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Create a binary number where '1' represents a dead prisoner and '0' a living one.  \n4. **Identifying the Poison:** Convert the resulting binary number back to decimal.

Here's why switching to Door No. 2 gives you the best advantage:* **Initial Choice:** When you initially chose Door No. 1, you had a 1\/3 chance of selecting the door with the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance of selecting a door with rotten vegetables.* **Host's Action:** The host *always* reveals rotten vegetables behind one of the doors you didn't pick. This action doesn't change the initial odds that your first choice was wrong (which was 2\/3).  Crucially, the host's knowledge of where the gold bar is allows them to concentrate the probability of the prize being behind the other unopened door.* **Switching:** When you switch to Door No. 2, you're essentially taking advantage of the concentrated 2\/3 probability that the gold bar is behind one of the doors you didn't initially choose. **In summary:**  While it feels counterintuitive, switching doors doubles your chances of winning the gold bar.\"}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"572":{"level_0":572,"index":3,"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.
