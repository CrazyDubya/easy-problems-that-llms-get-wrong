This strategy allows him to test a large number of bottles with a minimal number of prisoners and tests.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000. Since 10 bits are required to represent numbers up to 1000, each binary number will have 10 digits. For example, the first bottle would be labeled \"0000000000\", the second \"0000000001\", the third \"0000000010\", and so on, up to the thousandth bottle \"1111101000\".\n\n2. Assign each of the 10 prisoners to one of the 10 digits in the binary numbers. For example, the first prisoner would be responsible for the first digit, the second prisoner for the second digit, and so on.\n\n3. For each test, if a digit in a bottle's binary number is 1, give a sip of that wine to the corresponding prisoner. For example, if the third bottle has the binary number \"0000000010\", only the third prisoner would take a sip from it.\n\n4. After 24 hours, check which prisoners have died. The positions of the dead prisoners in the binary number will correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle. For example, if the fourth and seventh prisoners died, the poisoned bottle would be the one labeled \"0000100100\".\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing, making it the fastest method.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"17":{"level_0":17,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This strategy is based on the concept of binary numbers, where each test can be seen as a digit in a binary number. Each prisoner can test a combination of bottles, and the results can be interpreted as a binary number to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if we have 1000 bottles, we can label them from 0 to 999 in binary, which requires 10 digits (as 2^10 = 1024 > 1000).

For example, the first bottle would be 0000000001, the second 0000000010, the third 0000000011, and so on.\n\n2. Assign each prisoner to one of the 10 binary digits.

For example, the first prisoner would sip from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on (all the odd-numbered bottles), since the first digit is a 1 in their binary numbers.\n\n4.

This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number that requires no more than 10 digits (since there are 1000 bottles). For example, the first bottle would be 0000000001, the second 0000000010, the third 0000000011, and so on.\n\n2. Assign each prisoner to one of the 10 binary digits. For example, the first prisoner would be responsible for the first digit, the second prisoner for the second digit, and so on.\n\n3. For each bottle, give a sip of wine to the prisoners corresponding to the digits that are 1 in the bottle's binary number. For example, for the first bottle (0000000001), only the first prisoner would take a sip. For the second bottle (0000000010), only the second prisoner would take a sip. For the third bottle (0000000011), the first and second prisoners would take a sip.\n\n4. After 24 hours, check which prisoners have died. The binary number formed by their positions will correspond to the poisoned bottle. For example, if the first and third prisoners died, the poisoned bottle would be 0000000101 (the fifth bottle).\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one day, making it the fastest way.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"107":{"level_0":107,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number that requires no more than 10 digits (since there are 1000 bottles and 2^10 = 1024). For example, the first bottle would be 0000000001, the second 0000000010, the third 0000000011, and so on.\n\n2. Assign each prisoner to one of the binary digits. For example, the first prisoner would be responsible for the first digit, the second prisoner for the second digit, and so on.\n\n3. For each test, give each prisoner a sip of wine from each bottle where the corresponding binary digit is 1. For example, in the first test, the first prisoner would drink from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on (all bottles where the first digit is 1), the second prisoner from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, and so on (all bottles where the second digit is 1), and so on.\n\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners have died. The binary number formed by their positions will correspond to the poisoned bottle. For example, if the first and third prisoners die, the poisoned bottle would be 000000101 (the fifth bottle).\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in a single day, making it the fastest method.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"197":{"level_0":197,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Option C is not valid because the poison is not bitter but takes effect after 24 hours. Option D is also not valid because it would kill all the prisoners.\n\nThe correct answer is Option B. The king can use a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number that is 10 digits long (because we have 10 prisoners and 1000 bottles). This is possible because 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000.\n2. For each prisoner, assign them a specific digit in the binary number (1 through 10).\n3. If the digit for a prisoner is a 1 in a bottle's binary number, that prisoner drinks from that bottle.\n4. After 24 hours, the prisoners who are still alive correspond to digits that are 0 in the poisoned bottle's binary number, and the prisoners who died correspond to digits that are 1.\n5.

This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000. Since 10 bits are required to represent numbers up to 1000, each binary number will have 10 digits. For example, the first bottle would be labeled \"0000000000\", the second \"0000000001\", the third \"0000000010\", and so on, up to \"1111101000\" for the thousandth bottle.\n\n2. Assign each prisoner to one of the 10 digits in the binary number. For example, the first prisoner would be responsible for the first digit, the second prisoner for the second digit, and so on.\n\n3. For each test, if the digit a prisoner is responsible for is 1, they drink from the bottle. If it's 0, they don't. For example, if the third bottle (\"0000000010\") is being tested, only the third prisoner would drink from it.\n\n4. After 24 hours, the king can identify the poisoned bottle by looking at which prisoners survived and which didn't. The binary number corresponding to the poisoned bottle will have 1s in the positions corresponding to the prisoners who died, and 0s in the positions corresponding to the prisoners who survived.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle with only 10 tests (one for each prisoner), and he will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"257":{"level_0":257,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

In the classic birthday problem, you're looking for the probability that at least two people in a group share a birthday. With twins, the question becomes a bit simpler because twins share the same birthday.\n\nSo, instead of needing 23 people in a room for a 50% chance that two people share a birthday (as in the classic problem), you only need enough pairs of twins so that there's one more person than the number of days in a year. That's because, with 366 people (or 183 pairs of twins), there would be more people than days in a year, ensuring at least two people share a birthday.\n\nHowever, this is more than needed for a 50% chance. Since twins share a birthday, each pair of twins effectively \"occupies\" one day of the year. So, for a 50% chance that two people share a birthday, you would need enough pairs of twins to occupy half the days in a year.\n\nAssuming a non-leap year with 365 days, you would need 365\/2 = 182.5 pairs of twins.

Each digit position would correspond to a different prisoner.\n3. If a bottle's binary number has a 1 in a certain digit position, the corresponding prisoner would drink from that bottle.\n4.

In the classic birthday problem, you're looking for the probability that at least two people in a room share a birthday, regardless of the year. With twins, the question becomes a bit different, because twins share the same birthday.\n\nHowever, the twist is that the question asks for \"at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday,\" not necessarily that they are twins. This means that we need to consider the possibility of non-twin pairs sharing a birthday as well.\n\nIn a room full of twins, each pair of twins increases the number of people by two. So, we can think of this as adding two people at a time to the room and asking when the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday exceeds 50%.\n\nIn the classic birthday problem, the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday exceeds 50% when there are 23 people in the room. This is because, when considering the birthdays of 23 people, there are 365^23 total possible birthday combinations, but only 365*364*...*343 combinations where no two people share a birthday. The ratio of these two numbers is less than 0.5, meaning that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is more than 50%.\n\nSince we're adding two people at a time (in the form of twins), we would need 12 pairs of twins to reach 24 people, which is more than the 23 people needed for a greater than 50% chance that at least two people share a birthday.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"324":{"level_0":324,"index":25,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

This strategy allows him to test a large number of bottles with a minimal number of prisoners and tests.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000. Since 10 bits are required to represent numbers up to 1000, each binary number will have 10 digits. For example, the first bottle would be labeled \"0000000000\", the second \"0000000001\", the third \"0000000010\", and so on, up to the thousandth bottle \"1111101000\".\n\n2. Assign each of the 10 prisoners to one of the 10 digits in the binary numbers. For example, the first prisoner would be responsible for the first digit, the second prisoner for the second digit, and so on.\n\n3. For each test, if a digit in a bottle's binary number is 1, give a sip of that wine to the corresponding prisoner. For example, if the third bottle has the binary number \"0000000010\", only the third prisoner would take a sip from it.\n\n4. After 24 hours, check which prisoners have died. The positions of the dead prisoners in the binary number will correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle. For example, if the fourth and seventh prisoners died, the poisoned bottle would be the one labeled \"0000100100\".\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing, making it the fastest method.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"347":{"level_0":347,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This means the distance (d) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2) \u2248 1.414km.\n\nHis final elevation remains the same as the last point before his final turn, which is 900m, because he is moving horizontally in the final kilometer, not gaining or losing elevation.\n\nSo, the correct answer is not provided in the options.

So, the question becomes: How many individuals do you need in a room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday?\n\nThe classic birthday problem uses the complementary probability principle to solve this. The complementary probability is the probability that no two people share a birthday. This probability decreases as the number of people increases. When the number of people reaches 23, the complementary probability drops below 50%, meaning there's more than a 50% chance that at least two people share a birthday.\n\nSince we're dealing with pairs of twins, and each pair counts as two individuals, we would need 23 individuals, or 12 pairs of twins (23 divided by 2, rounded up because you can't have half a pair).\n\nSo, the answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"444":{"level_0":444,"index":25,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. In this case, each prisoner can test a combination of bottles, and the results can be interpreted as a binary number. This way, the king can test up to 1023 bottles (2^10 - 1) in just one round of testing, which will take 24 hours.\n\nFor example, if we number the bottles from 0 to 1023, we can assign each prisoner to test a specific set of bottles. Prisoner 1 tests the bottles numbered 1, 3, 5, 7, ... (all the odd-numbered bottles), prisoner 2 tests bottles numbered 2, 3, 6, 7, ... (bottles that are multiples of 2), prisoner 3 tests bottles numbered 4, 5, 6, 7, ... (bottles that are multiples of 4), and so on. If a prisoner dies, the king knows that the poisoned bottle is one of the bottles that prisoner tested. By looking at the combination of prisoners who died, the king can identify the exact bottle number in binary.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A.

This is because turning all of the switches on at once (option B) would not allow you to differentiate between the bulbs. Option D is not applicable because the bulbs are LED and do not get warm when turned on. Option A is not necessary because you can observe the bulbs from the same room as the switches.

This strategy is based on the concept of binary numbers, where each digit can be either 0 or 1. In this case, each prisoner can be thought of as a digit, and each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Assign each bottle a unique binary number of length 10 (since there are 10 prisoners). For example, the first bottle would be 0000000001, the second bottle would be 0000000010, the third bottle would be 0000000011, and so on, up to the 1000th bottle, which would be 1111101000.\n\n2. For each bottle, give a sip of wine to the prisoners corresponding to the digits that are 1 in the bottle's binary number. For example, for the first bottle, only the last prisoner would get a sip, since the binary number 0000000001 has a 1 only in the last digit. For the second bottle, only the second-last prisoner would get a sip, and so on.\n\n3. After 24 hours, see which prisoners have died. The binary number corresponding to the poisoned bottle is the one where the digits are 1 for the prisoners who have died and 0 for the prisoners who have survived.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one day, since the effects of the poison take exactly 24 hours to manifest.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"497":{"level_0":497,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

If a prisoner dies, the king will know that the bottle corresponding to the binary number that includes a 1 in the position of the dead prisoner is the poisoned one.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours.\n\nReturning in JSON format:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"527":{"level_0":527,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Label each bottle with a unique binary number that requires no more than 10 digits (since there are 1000 bottles and 2^10 = 1024).

After 24 hours, if a prisoner dies, it means the poisoned bottle has a 1 in the corresponding digit. If a prisoner survives, it means the poisoned bottle has a 0 in the corresponding digit.\n\n5.
