This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number that requires no more than 10 digits (since there are 1000 bottles and 2^10 = 1024). For example, the first bottle would be 0000000001, the second 0000000010, the third 0000000011, and so on.\n\n2. Assign each prisoner to one of the 10 binary digits. For example, the first prisoner would be responsible for the first digit, the second prisoner for the second digit, and so on.\n\n3. For each test, give each prisoner a sip from all the bottles where their assigned digit is a 1 in the bottle's binary number. For example, the first prisoner would sip from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on (all the odd-numbered bottles), since the first digit is a 1 in their binary numbers.\n\n4. After 24 hours, the king can identify the poisoned bottle by looking at which prisoners survived and which didn't. The binary number corresponding to the poisoned bottle is the one where the digits are 1 for the prisoners who died and 0 for the prisoners who survived.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of tests, with results available in 24 hours.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
