Turning each switch on one at a time and observing the bulbs.**\n\n* **A. Turning all of the switches on at once and observing the bulbs.** This tells you all the bulbs work, but not which switch controls which.\n* **B. Turning two switches on for a while, turn one off, then touching the bulbs to see which is warm and which one is on.** This strategy is irrelevant because the prompt states the bulbs are LEDs and won't get warm. \n* **C. You must walk into another room to observe the bulbs.**  You don't need to leave the room to figure this out.\n* **D. Turning each switch on one at a time and observing the bulbs.** This is the most straightforward method.

Plus, you'd need 1000 prisoners.\n    * **B:**  Each prisoner would drink a huge amount of wine, likely leading to death from alcohol poisoning long before the actual poison takes effect.\n    * **C:** The poison is stated to be bitter, but the question focuses on finding the poison *after* it takes effect, implying the taste might be indistinguishable.\n\n* **Why D is the solution:**\n    * **Binary Search:** This is a highly efficient search method. Here's how it applies:\n        1. **Number the Bottles:** Assign each bottle a number from 1 to 1000.\n        2. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n        3. **Binary Representation:** Think of each prisoner as representing a place value in a binary number (e.g., prisoner 1 is the 'ones' place, prisoner 2 is the 'twos' place, prisoner 3 is the 'fours' place, and so on, up to prisoner 10 representing 2^9).\n        4. **Give Wine Based on Binary:**  For each bottle, give a sip to the prisoners whose number corresponds to a '1' in the bottle's binary representation. \n           * Example: Bottle 5 (binary 0000000101) would be sipped by prisoners 1 and 3.\n        5. **Observe After 24 Hours:** The prisoners who die represent '1's in the binary representation of the poisoned bottle. \n           * Example: If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0001001001, which converts to decimal 585. Bottle 585 was poisoned.\n\n    * **Efficiency:** Binary search allows you to test a large number of possibilities quickly. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles in a single round. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
