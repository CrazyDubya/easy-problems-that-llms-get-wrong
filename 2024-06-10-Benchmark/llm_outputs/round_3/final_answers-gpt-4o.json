Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Choice**: You initially pick Door No. 1. The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, offers you the chance to switch to Door No. 2. Importantly, the host's offer implies that Door No. 2 is not the door with the rotten vegetables (if it were, the host would not offer it as an option).\n\n3. **Switching Strategy**: If you switch to Door No. 2, you are effectively betting that the gold bar is behind one of the two doors you did not initially pick (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3). Since the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge of the contents behind the doors, switching increases your chances of winning.\n\n4. **Probability Analysis**:\n   - If you stick with Door No. 1, your probability of winning remains 1\/3.\n   - If you switch to Door No. 2, your probability of winning becomes 2\/3 because the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge that Door No. 2 is not a losing door.\n\nTherefore, switching to Door No. 2 gives you the highest probability of winning the gold bar.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This means there is only one empty chamber. When your opponent spins the chambers and fires at himself, he lands on the empty chamber, so there are now five chambers left, all of which are loaded with bullets.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, you will be firing the revolver with the chamber that is currently next in line. Since there are five bullets and one empty chamber, the probability of the next chamber being empty (and thus safe for you) is 0\/5, which means you will definitely hit a bullet.\n\nIf you spin the chambers again, you reset the probabilities. With five bullets and one empty chamber, the probability of landing on the empty chamber is 1\/6.\n\nTherefore, by spinning the chambers again, you increase your chances of survival from 0% to approximately 16.67% (1\/6).\n\nGiven this analysis, the best choice is to spin the chambers again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

For example, if a bottle is represented by the binary number 1010101010, then prisoners 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 will taste that bottle (since those positions have a '1').\n\n3. **Interpreting Results**: After 24 hours, the combination of which prisoners die will form a binary number.
