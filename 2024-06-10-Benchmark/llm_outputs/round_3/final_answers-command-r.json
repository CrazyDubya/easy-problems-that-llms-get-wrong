If my opponent has fired at themselves without any bullet being discharged, it means that the chamber they pulled the trigger on was empty. \n\nThere are two scenarios to consider:\n\n1. The chamber that was empty after the first spin. If it's left unchanged, it will still be empty after a second spin. As a result, your odds of survival will be higher if you keep the chambers as they are.\n\n2. Alternatively, if the cylinder is spun again, each pull of the trigger will have a 1\/6 chance of being the empty chamber. This is because each chamber has an equal likelihood of being aligned after a spin, and one of the chambers is known to be empty. While this scenario appears to be more fortunate, it also introduces the possibility of landing a loaded chamber and perilously increasing your odds of harm.\n\nGiven these possibilities, the sensible course of action would be to go with the known outcome and choose D: You should not spin the chambers again.","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.
