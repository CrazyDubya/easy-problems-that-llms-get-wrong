Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n\nExplanation:\nThe fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from one bottle in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours. If none of the prisoners die, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was not tested. If one prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in their group.\n4. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles and prisoners until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to narrow down the search for the poisoned bottle quickly and efficiently, without risking the lives of all 10 prisoners. It also ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours, which is critical for the event.\n\nOption A is not feasible because it would require all prisoners to drink from all 1000 bottles, which is not possible in 24 hours. Option B is not optimal because it does not minimize the number of tests needed. Option C is not reliable because the poison may not have a bitter taste.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
