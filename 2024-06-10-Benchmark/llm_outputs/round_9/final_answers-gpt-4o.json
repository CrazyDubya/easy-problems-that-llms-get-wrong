Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Choice**: You pick Door No. 1. The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, will always open one of the doors you did not pick (either Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) to reveal a rotten vegetable. This action does not change the initial probabilities but provides additional information.\n\n3. **Switching Doors**: After the host reveals a rotten vegetable behind one of the doors you did not pick, you are given the option to switch your choice to the other unopened door. \n\n   - If the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 (your initial choice), switching will make you lose. The probability of this is 1\/3.\n   - If the gold bar is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3), the host's action ensures that the unopened door (the one you can switch to) has the gold bar. The probability of this is 2\/3.\n\nTherefore, switching doors gives you a 2\/3 chance of winning the gold bar, while sticking with your initial choice gives you only a 1\/3 chance.\n\nGiven that the host asks if you want to pick Door No. 2 instead, the best strategy is to switch from your initial choice (Door No. 1) to Door No. 2.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Since your opponent fired and no bullet came out, we know that the chamber he fired was the one empty chamber. Now, there are 5 chambers left, and 5 bullets in those chambers.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, the probability of the next chamber containing a bullet is 5\/5, or 100%. This is because there are 5 bullets left in the 5 remaining chambers.\n\nIf you spin the chambers again, you reset the probabilities. With 6 chambers and 5 bullets, the probability of firing a blank is 1\/6, and the probability of firing a bullet is 5\/6.\n\nComparing the two scenarios:\n- Not spinning: 100% chance of firing a bullet.\n- Spinning: 5\/6 (approximately 83.33%) chance of firing a bullet.\n\nSince 83.33% is less than 100%, you have a better chance of survival if you spin the chambers again.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to spin the chambers again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Here's how:\n\nAsk either guardian the following question: \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would they point to?\"\n\n- If you ask the truth-telling guardian, they will truthfully tell you that the lying guardian would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the lying guardian, they will lie about what the truth-telling guardian would say, and thus also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the door they indicate will be the death door.

Turning each switch on one at a time and observing the bulbs: This method will allow you to see which bulb lights up for each switch, but it assumes you can observe the bulbs directly from where the switches are located. If you can see the bulbs from the switches, this method is straightforward and effective.\n\nB.

If this is the case, you need a method that allows you to identify the bulbs without being able to see them directly while operating the switches.\n\nC. Turning all of the switches on at once and observing the bulbs: This method will not help you determine which switch controls which bulb because all bulbs will be on simultaneously, and you won't be able to distinguish which switch controls which bulb.\n\nD. Turning two switches on for a while, turn one off, then touching the bulbs to see which is warm and which one is on: This method is invalid because the bulbs are LED and do not get warm.\n\nGiven the constraints and the need to identify the switches and bulbs uniquely, the best method is to turn each switch on one at a time and observe the bulbs, assuming you can see the bulbs from the switches.

The key is to use a strategy that maximizes the information we can get from the limited number of prisoners.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\nA. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\n- This method would require each prisoner to test 100 bottles. If a prisoner dies, we would only know that one of the 100 bottles they tested is poisoned, but we wouldn't know which one. This is not efficient.\n\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\n- This method is impractical because it would require each prisoner to drink from all 1000 bottles, which is not feasible and would likely result in multiple deaths.\n\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n- This method assumes that the poison can be detected by taste, which is not stated in the problem. Additionally, it doesn't leverage the 24-hour delay in the poison's effect.\n\nD. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours.\n- This method is the most efficient. By using a binary representation, each bottle can be assigned a unique 10-bit binary number (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000). Each prisoner will drink from bottles based on the binary digits. For example, prisoner 1 drinks from all bottles where the least significant bit is 1, prisoner 2 drinks from all bottles where the second least significant bit is 1, and so on. After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number that directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the most efficient and logical choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

However, you have already spent \\( \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours walking to your friend's house. This leaves no time for the return trip.\n\nSince there is no time left for the return trip, you would need to run back infinitely fast to achieve the desired average speed of 6 mph for the entire trip.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""}}
