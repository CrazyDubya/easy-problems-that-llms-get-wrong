Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"This problem is a classic example of the Monty Hall problem. Here's the explanation:\n\nWhen you first pick a door (let's say door No. 1), there's a 1\/3 chance that the gold bar is behind that door, and a 2\/3 chance that the gold bar is behind one of the other two doors (either No. 2 or No. 3).\n\nWhen the host, who knows what's behind the doors, offers you the chance to switch to door No. 2, it doesn't simply become a 50\/50 chance. The key is that the host's action of offering you another door (assuming they always do this when you've initially chosen the door with the gold bar or not) is part of the game's strategy.\n\nIf the gold bar was behind your initial choice (1\/3 chance), switching would lose. However, if the gold bar was not behind your initial choice (2\/3 chance), switching would win. This is because if you initially chose a door with rotten vegetables (2\/3 chance), the host's offer to switch is essentially revealing that the gold bar is behind the other unchosen door, since they would never open the door with the gold bar.\n\nTherefore, switching doors (to door No. 2 in this scenario, but the specific number doesn't matter) after the host offers you the chance to switch gives you a 2\/3 chance of winning the gold bar, while sticking with your initial choice gives you only a 1\/3 chance.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"To solve this classic problem, we need to ensure that at no point are the wolf and the goat left alone without the farmer, and similarly, the goat and the cabbage cannot be left alone. Given the constraints and the boat's capacity to carry all three (wolf, goat, and cabbage) in separate compartments simultaneously, the traditional problem usually limits the boat's capacity, making the puzzle more challenging. However, with this unique condition allowing all three to be transported at once if needed, the puzzle's dynamic changes. \n\nHere's a step-by-step solution considering the usual constraints of one item per crossing:\n\n1. The farmer takes the goat across the river first, leaving the wolf and the cabbage on the initial side. This prevents the goat from being eaten by the wolf or the goat eating the cabbage. (1 crossing)\n2. The farmer returns alone to the original side to get either the wolf or the cabbage. Let's say he takes the wolf next. (2 crossings)\n3. The farmer leaves the wolf on the other side but takes the goat back with him to the original side. This is because he cannot leave the wolf and goat together. (3 crossings)\n4. The farmer then takes the cabbage across, leaving it with the wolf. He cannot leave the goat and cabbage together. (4 crossings)\n5. Finally, the farmer returns alone to the original side and takes the goat across again. (5 crossings)\n\nGiven the scenario described in the question, it seems there's a misunderstanding in the interpretation due to the unique condition of the boat having three secure separate compartments, which is not typically part of the classic problem. This condition implies all three can be transported simultaneously without any risk of one eating the other, which would theoretically allow for a single crossing if the problem were taken at face value. However, the traditional solution logic and the puzzle's intent suggest the farmer can only take one at a time, leading to multiple crossings.\n\nGiven the traditional constraints and the usual goal of the puzzle, the correct answer, based on the step-by-step solution provided, is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```\n\nThis solution assumes the traditional constraint of transporting only one item (wolf, goat, or cabbage) at a time, despite the unique condition mentioned.

By labeling the bottles 1 to 1000 and converting those numbers into binary, each prisoner can be assigned a position in a 10-digit binary number (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000, thus 10 prisoners are sufficient to test all bottles). Each prisoner drinks from the bottles for which their position in the binary number is a '1'. After 24 hours, the combination of who gets poisoned and who doesn't directly points to the poisoned bottle, as the binary number formed by the outcome (1 for poisoned, 0 for not poisoned) will correspond to the poisoned bottle's number in binary.\n\nThis method is efficient because it requires only one round of testing and can precisely identify the poisoned bottle among 1000 with just 10 prisoners, without needing to taste for bitterness or risking multiple prisoners' lives unnecessarily.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
