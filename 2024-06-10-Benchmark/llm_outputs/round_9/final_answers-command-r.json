This is because, in two races, there will always be a clear winner between the two horses who placed first. With six horses, we would need three races to determine the overall winner, as follows:\n\n- Race 1: Horses A, B, C\n- Race 2: Horses D, E, F\n- Race 3: Winners of A vs Winners of B (eg. If Horse A wins Race 1, and Horse D wins Race 2, then Horse A and Horse D compete in the third race)\n\nThis ensures that, over the course of the three races, the fastest horse is guaranteed to place first.","score":""},"2":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a gold bar; behind the others, rotten vegetables.

According to the birthday problem, a room of 23 people guarantees a 50\/50 chance that at least two people share a birthday. \n\nTo apply this to the scenario of pairs of twins, each pair represents two people, so we need enough pairs to reach a total of 23 individuals.
