The key is that the host knows what's behind the doors and always opens a door with rotten vegetables after you make your initial pick. \n\nWhen you first choose door 1, you have a 1\/3 chance of the gold bar being behind that door. The other 2\/3 chance is that the gold bar is behind one of the other two doors.\n\nAfter you pick door 1, the host, who knows where the gold bar is, opens another door, say door 3, to reveal rotten vegetables. The host always opens a door that doesn't have the prize.\n\nNow you have a choice to stick with door 1 or switch to door 2. Here's why you should switch:\n\n- If the gold bar is behind door 1 (1\/3 chance), switching loses.\n- But if the gold bar is behind door 2 (2\/3 chance), switching wins.\n\nSo by switching, you win if the gold bar was originally behind doors 2 or 3, which is a 2\/3 chance. Sticking with door 1 only wins if the gold bar was originally behind door 1, which is only a 1\/3 chance.\n\nTherefore, you double your chances of winning by switching from door 1 to door 2 when given the chance.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

A binary search strategy is optimal.\n\nHere's how it would work:\n- Number the bottles from 1 to 1000\n- Have each prisoner sample wine from specific bottles based on the binary representation of the bottle numbers\n- For example:\n    - Prisoner 1 samples every bottle whose number has a 1 in the 1's place (odd numbers)\n    - Prisoner 2 samples every bottle with a 1 in the 2's place (2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, ...)\n    - Prisoner 3 samples every bottle with a 1 in the 4's place (4-7, 12-15, 20-23, ...)\n    - And so on for all 10 prisoners, with the 10th prisoner sampling bottles with a 1 in the 512's place\n- After 24 hours, line up the prisoners in order\n- The poisoned bottle number will be revealed by considering each prisoner that died as a 1 and each that lived as a 0\n- For example, if prisoners 1, 4, 5, and 7 died, the poisoned bottle number is 0101010001 in binary, or 337 in decimal\n\nThis leverages the prisoners as \"bits\" to efficiently search the sample space in the minimum number of tests. The other options either require too many tests or rely on taste which may be unreliable.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

While diverting the trolley would save the five lives, variants of the dilemma sometimes pose that there is one person on the alternate track who would be killed instead. This creates a moral quandary about whether it is right to take an action that kills one to save a greater number.
