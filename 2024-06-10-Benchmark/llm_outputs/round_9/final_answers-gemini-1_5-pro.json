What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nD. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"D\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is D and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:**  The king needs to find a single poisoned bottle out of 1000, and he only has time for one round of testing (since the poison takes 24 hours to work).\n\n* **Why A, B, and C are incorrect:**\n    * **A & B:** These methods would likely kill all the prisoners as they involve each prisoner consuming from multiple bottles, making it impossible to isolate the poisoned one.\n    * **C:**  The poison is described as bitter, but there's no guarantee it would be detectable by taste alone. It could be tasteless and odorless.\n\n* **Why D is correct (Binary Search):**\n\n    1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10. Convert each prisoner's number into its binary equivalent (e.g., Prisoner 1 is 001, Prisoner 2 is 010, Prisoner 3 is 011, etc.).  Think of each digit in the binary number as representing a specific group of bottles.\n\n    2. **Assigning Wine:** Each bottle of wine is also assigned a number from 1 to 1000.  Convert each bottle's number to its binary equivalent (up to 10 digits since 1000 in binary is 1111101000).  A prisoner will drink from a bottle if their corresponding binary digit is a '1'.\n\n       * **Example:** Bottle 5 (binary 0000000101) would be given to prisoners 1 and 3.\n\n    3. **Identifying the Poison:** After 24 hours, the pattern of deceased prisoners will directly translate back into the binary representation of the poisoned bottle number. \n\n       * **Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0010000101, which converts to decimal 525. Bottle 525 was poisoned.\n\n* **Efficiency:**  Binary search is incredibly efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles in a single round. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
