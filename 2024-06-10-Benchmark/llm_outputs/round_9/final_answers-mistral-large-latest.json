Race 2: Race the fastest horses from each group against each other. The winner of this race is the fastest horse overall.\n3.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy. This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000. Since 10 bits are required to represent numbers up to 1000, each binary number will have 10 digits. For example, the first bottle would be labeled \"0000000000\", the second \"0000000001\", the third \"0000000010\", and so on, up to \"1111101000\" for the thousandth bottle.\n\n2. Assign each prisoner to one of the 10 digits in the binary number. For example, the first prisoner would be responsible for the first digit, the second prisoner for the second digit, and so on.\n\n3. For each test, if the digit a prisoner is responsible for is 1, they drink from the bottle. If it's 0, they don't. For example, if the third bottle (\"0000000010\") is being tested, only the third prisoner would drink from it.\n\n4. After 24 hours, the king can identify the poisoned bottle by looking at which prisoners survived and which didn't. The binary number corresponding to the poisoned bottle will have 1s in the positions corresponding to the prisoners who died, and 0s in the positions corresponding to the prisoners who survived.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle with only 10 tests (one for each prisoner), and he will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

In the classic birthday problem, you're looking for the probability that at least two people in a group share a birthday. With twins, the question becomes a bit simpler because twins share the same birthday.\n\nSo, instead of needing 23 people in a room for a 50% chance that two people share a birthday (as in the classic problem), you only need enough pairs of twins so that there's one more person than the number of days in a year. That's because, with 366 people (or 183 pairs of twins), there would be more people than days in a year, ensuring at least two people share a birthday.\n\nHowever, this is more than needed for a 50% chance. Since twins share a birthday, each pair of twins effectively \"occupies\" one day of the year. So, for a 50% chance that two people share a birthday, you would need enough pairs of twins to occupy half the days in a year.\n\nAssuming a non-leap year with 365 days, you would need 365\/2 = 182.5 pairs of twins. Since you can't have half a pair, you'd round up to 183 pairs to ensure a greater than 50% chance.\n\nHowever, none of the provided answers match this calculation.
