The probability that the gold bar is behind this door is 1\/3, and the probability that it's behind either of the other two doors is 2\/3.\n3. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, offers you a switch to door No. 2. This is a crucial point: the host's action of offering a switch after you've made an initial choice changes the probabilities because the host will always avoid revealing the gold bar and will only offer a switch if your initial choice was incorrect or to create suspense.\n4. If you stick with door No. 1, your probability of winning remains 1\/3.

Given that the boat has three secure separate compartments, it's possible to transport all three (the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage) across the river without any of them being eaten, provided the farmer strategizes the crossings correctly. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. The farmer takes the goat across the river first, leaving the wolf and the cabbage on the initial side. This ensures that the goat won't eat the cabbage and the wolf won't eat the goat in his absence. (1 crossing)\n2. The farmer then returns alone to the original side to get either the wolf or the cabbage. Let's say he takes the wolf next. (2 crossings)\n3. Upon reaching the other side with the wolf, he cannot leave the wolf with the goat. So, he takes the goat back with him to the original side while leaving the wolf on the other side. (3 crossings)\n4. The farmer then takes the cabbage across the river, leaving it with the wolf. Since the wolf won't eat the cabbage, this is safe. (4 crossings)\n5. Finally, the farmer returns alone to the original side to get the goat and brings it across the river. (5 crossings)\n\nThis sequence ensures that the goat is never left alone with the wolf without the farmer's supervision, and the goat is never left alone with the cabbage. Therefore, the minimum number of crossings needed to bring the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage across the river without anything being eaten is five.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"5":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"Bob has three boxes in front of him - Box A, Box B and Box C.

The growth of the tree does not consume the soil in a way that reduces the soil's mass.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"To solve this problem, let's first understand what is being asked. The question is about doubling the average speed for the entire trip, which includes both walking to the friend's house and running back. \n\nLet's denote:\n- The distance to the friend's house as \\(D\\) miles.\n- The walking speed as 3 mph, so the time to walk to the friend's house is \\(T_{walk} = \\frac{D}{3}\\) hours.\n- The running speed back as \\(R\\) mph, and we need to find this value. The time to run back is \\(T_{run} = \\frac{D}{R}\\) hours.\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is calculated as the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance for the round trip is \\(2D\\) miles, and the total time is \\(T_{walk} + T_{run} = \\frac{D}{3} + \\frac{D}{R}\\) hours.\n\nThe question states that we want to double the average speed of the entire trip compared to just walking to the friend's house. The average speed of walking to the friend's house is 3 mph, so the target average speed for the entire trip is \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) mph.\n\nSetting up the equation for average speed for the entire trip:\n\\[Average\\ Speed = \\frac{Total\\ Distance}{Total\\ Time} = \\frac{2D}{\\frac{D}{3} + \\frac{D}{R}}\\]\n\nWe set this equal to 6 mph (the target average speed):\n\\[6 = \\frac{2D}{\\frac{D}{3} + \\frac{D}{R}}\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[6\\left(\\frac{D}{3} + \\frac{D}{R}\\right) = 2D\\]\n\n\\[2D + \\frac{6D}{R} = 2D\\]\n\nSince \\(2D\\) cancels out on both sides, we are left with an equation that does not make sense in this context, indicating a mistake in our simplification process. The correct approach to find the necessary running speed to achieve the desired average speed involves understanding that the average speed for the entire trip being double the walking speed (6 mph) implies a certain relationship between the distances and times, not directly doubling the speed of each leg of the trip.\n\nLet's correct the approach:\n\nThe correct way to think about this problem is to realize that doubling the average speed of the entire trip is not as straightforward as doubling the speed of one leg of the trip. The mistake was in the simplification and the interpretation of how average speed works over a round trip. \n\nTo achieve an average speed of 6 mph over the entire trip, the total time needs to be considered. However, the key insight is that if you spend the same amount of time walking at 3 mph as you do running back, you cannot achieve an average speed of 6 mph for the entire trip because the time spent on each leg affects the overall average speed.\n\nGiven the mistake in the initial explanation, let's directly address the question without the incorrect simplification:\n\nTo actually double the average speed for the entire trip, considering the initial speed is 3 mph for half the distance, the problem essentially asks under what conditions the average speed for the entire trip can be made to look like the runner ran the entire distance (both to the friend's house and back) at 6 mph. However, since the first half of the trip is at 3 mph, to average out to 6 mph for the entire distance, the return trip would theoretically need to be instantaneous (or infinitely fast), because any time spent on the return trip at a finite speed would result in an average speed for the entire trip of less than 6 mph.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```\nThis reflects the understanding that to double the average speed of the entire trip, given the constraints, is not possible with a finite speed due to the way average speeds are calculated over different segments of a trip.","score":""}}
