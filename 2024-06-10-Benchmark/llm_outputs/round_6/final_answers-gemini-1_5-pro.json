Here's why the best choice is to switch to **Door No. 2**:\n\n* **Initial Choice:** When you initially chose Door No. 1, you had a 1\/3 chance of selecting the door with the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance of selecting a door with rotten vegetables.\n* **Host's Action:** The host *always* reveals rotten vegetables behind one of the doors you didn't pick. This action doesn't change the initial odds that your first choice was wrong (which was 2\/3).  Crucially, the host's knowledge of where the gold bar is allows them to concentrate the probability.\n* **The Switch:** When you switch to Door No. 2, you're essentially taking advantage of the concentrated probability. That 2\/3 chance of being initially wrong is now focused on the single remaining door. \n\n**In simpler terms:** By switching, you're betting on the higher probability that you initially picked a door with rotten vegetables. \n","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

If a prisoner dies, their corresponding digit represents a '1' in the poisoned bottle's binary number. If they live, it's a '0'.\n5. **Construct the Binary Number:** Combine the dead\/alive results to form the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\n**Why Binary Search is Efficient:**  Binary search allows you to test a large number of possibilities quickly. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles in a single round. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
