The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is to use a binary search strategy. This strategy allows him to test multiple bottles at once and eliminate large groups of bottles based on the results.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique number between 0 and 999, which can be represented in binary using 10 digits (e.g., 0000000000 for bottle 0, 1111111111 for bottle 999).\n2. Assign each of the 10 prisoners to one of the binary digits.\n3. For each prisoner, have them drink from all the bottles where their assigned digit is a 1.\n4. Wait 24 hours to see which prisoners die. The pattern of dead and alive prisoners will correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle's number.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 8 die, the poisoned bottle would be represented by the binary number 1001000000, which corresponds to bottle 512.\n\nThis method allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing, making it the fastest way to find the poisoned bottle.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
