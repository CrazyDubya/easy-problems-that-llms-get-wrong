To double my average speed for the return trip, I need to sustain 6mph. However, since the walk to my friend's house took an hour, it follows that running back at 6mph would still take that same hour, which doesn't double my average speed across the entire trip. Therefore the correct answer can't be B.\n\nTo actually double my average speed for the entire trip, I'd need to run back to my starting point at 9mph, which takes 1\/2 an hour, and averages out to 6.5mph over the whole journey.
