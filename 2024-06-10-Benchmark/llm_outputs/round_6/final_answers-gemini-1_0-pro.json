Analyzing the provided options:\n\n**A. Divide the bottles amongst the prisoners:** This approach, while seemingly straightforward, presents a major flaw. With 1000 bottles and only 10 prisoners, each prisoner would have to consume 100 bottles. Since the poison takes 24 hours to show effect, this method wouldn't yield results within the timeframe.\n\n**B. Binary search strategy:** This option offers a more efficient approach. By assigning each prisoner a unique binary code and having them taste wines corresponding to their code's 1s, the king can narrow down the possibilities with each round of tasting. This method, however, requires careful planning and execution to ensure accurate results within the 24-hour window.\n\n**C. Sample each bottle and observe deaths:** This method, while seemingly definitive, comes with a significant ethical dilemma. Sacrificing all prisoners to identify the poisoned bottle is a cruel and unnecessary approach.\n\n**D. Divide the bottles and observe deaths:** This option presents a more feasible solution. By dividing the bottles amongst the prisoners and observing who dies within 24 hours, the king can pinpoint the poisoned bottle. While this method involves sacrificing some prisoners, it minimizes the number of casualties compared to option C.\n\nTherefore, the optimal approach is:\n\n**{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}**\n\nThis method balances efficiency and minimizes sacrifice, allowing the king to identify the poisoned bottle within the 24-hour timeframe. \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Fill the 5-gallon jug completely.\n2. Pour the water from the 5-gallon jug into the 3-gallon jug until the 3-gallon jug is full. This leaves 2 gallons in the 5-gallon jug.\n3. Empty the 3-gallon jug.\n4. Pour the remaining 2 gallons from the 5-gallon jug into the 3-gallon jug.\n5. Fill the 5-gallon jug again.\n6. Pour water from the 5-gallon jug into the 3-gallon jug until the 3-gallon jug is full. This will leave exactly 4 gallons in the 5-gallon jug.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis method utilizes the 3-gallon and 5-gallon jugs to measure and transfer water efficiently. By filling and emptying the jugs strategically, we can achieve the desired 4 gallons in the 5-gallon jug. \n\n**Note:**\n\nOption B is not efficient as it only uses the 5-gallon and 4-gallon jugs, leaving the 3-gallon and 2-gallon jugs unused. Option C is not stated in the question, so it cannot be considered. Option D only uses the 2-gallon jug, which is not sufficient to measure 4 gallons.","score":""},"28":{"category":"Popular science","question":"A 2kg tree grows in a planted pot with 10kg of soil.

As the tree grows from 2kg to 3kg, it gains 1kg. This 1kg of growth is not added to the soil weight, so the final weight of the soil remains at 10kg. \n\nTherefore, when the tree weighs 3kg, there is still 10kg of soil left in the pot. \n","score":""},"29":{"category":"Relational","question":"A man steps over a 0.5m hurdle.

We also know that the distance walked and the distance run are the same. \n\nTherefore, we can rewrite the formula as:\n\n```\n6 mph = (2 * Distance) \/ (Time walking + Time running)\n```\n\nWe can then solve for the time running:\n\n```\nTime running = (2 * Distance) \/ (6 mph) - Time walking\n```\n\nSince the time walking is equal to the distance walked divided by the walking speed (3 mph), we can substitute that in:\n\n```\nTime running = (2 * Distance) \/ (6 mph) - Distance \/ (3 mph)\n```\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n```\nTime running = Distance \/ (6 mph)\n```\n\nThis means that the time running is equal to half the time walking. Therefore, the running speed needs to be twice the walking speed, which is 6 mph.\n\n## Answer:\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""}}
