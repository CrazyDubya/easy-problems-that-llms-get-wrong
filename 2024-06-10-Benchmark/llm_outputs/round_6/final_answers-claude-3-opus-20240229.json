Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD.

By assigning each bottle a unique 10-digit binary number and having each prisoner sample the bottles corresponding to their assigned binary digit, the poisoned bottle can be identified based on which prisoners show symptoms after 24 hours. This allows testing 1000 bottles with just 10 prisoners in a single 24 hour period, which is the most efficient approach. The other options would either take too long (sampling one by one) or are too risky (having prisoners sample every bottle).\",\n  \"ANSWER\": \"B\"\n}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

However, there may be people on the other track who could be harmed or killed by diverting the trolley. Choosing to pull the lever means actively deciding to put some people at risk to save others. Not pulling it means allowing the five to die through inaction. There are arguments on both sides, which is what makes this an ethical dilemma with no clear right answer.
