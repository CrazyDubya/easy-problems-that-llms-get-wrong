Since the bulbs are LED and don't get warm when turned on, we can't use temperature to identify them.\n\nOption A, turning all switches on at once, won't help us identify which switch controls which bulb, as all bulbs will be on simultaneously.\n\nOption B, walking into another room, is irrelevant to the problem, as we need to observe the bulbs in the same room to determine the switch-bulb connections.\n\nOption D, turning two switches on for a while, turning one off, and then touching the bulbs, is also not a viable solution, as the bulbs don't get warm when turned on, so we can't use temperature to identify them.\n\nThe best approach is Option C, turning each switch on one at a time and observing the bulbs. By doing so, we can systematically identify which switch controls which bulb. For example, we can turn switch A on and observe which bulb turns on. Then, turn switch A off and turn switch B on, observing which bulb turns on. Finally, turn switch B off and turn switch C on, observing which bulb turns on.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"Here's my explanation and answer:\n\nThe key to this problem is to use the prisoners efficiently to test the wine and minimize the number of tests needed. Option A is not feasible because the poison takes effect 24 hours after consumption, so the prisoners won't be able to taste the bitterness immediately. Option C is also not a good approach because it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is impractical and would likely result in many deaths.\n\nOption D is also not the best approach because it would require dividing the 1000 bottles among the 10 prisoners, which means each prisoner would have to test around 100 bottles. This would still result in many deaths and may not even guarantee that the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThe best approach is Option B, which uses a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle of wine with a binary number from 0 to 999 (using 10 binary digits).\n2. Divide the prisoners into two groups of 5.\n3. For each binary digit (from right to left), have one group of prisoners drink the wine from bottles with a 0 in that digit position, and the other group drink from bottles with a 1 in that digit position.\n4. Wait 24 hours and observe which prisoners die.\n5. Based on the results, eliminate half of the bottles (those that correspond to the digit position that caused the deaths).\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until only one bottle remains.\n\nThis approach ensures that the poisoned bottle is identified in the minimum number of tests (10 prisoners x 10 binary digits = 100 tests). The king will know the results in 24 hours, and only 10 prisoners will be used.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

We want to find the smallest value of x such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%.\n\nThe probability of two people sharing a birthday is 1\/365, since there are 365 possible birthdays (ignoring February 29th for simplicity). The probability of a single person not sharing a birthday with anyone else is therefore 364\/365.\n\nFor a group of 2x people, the probability that no two people share a birthday is (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-2x+1)\/365). This is because each person has a decreasing number of possible birthdays that don't match anyone else's.\n\nWe want to find the smallest x such that the probability of no two people sharing a birthday is less than or equal to 50%.

This means that there is no such thing as a \"last\" room, and we can always find a way to accommodate one more guest.\n\nAt first glance, it might seem like option B is the correct answer: just put the new guest in an empty room. However, the puzzle states that the hotel is \"partially full\", which implies that there are already guests occupying some of the rooms. We can't assume that there's an empty room available.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, as we'll see, it is possible to accommodate one more guest.\n\nNow, let's consider options C and D. Both of these options involve moving existing guests to make room for the new guest. The difference between them is the strategy for moving guests.\n\nOption C, \"You ask each current guest to move to the next room\", would work if the hotel had a finite number of rooms. However, with an infinite number of rooms, this approach would lead to a never-ending chain of room swaps, and we'd never actually free up a room for the new guest.\n\nOption D, \"You ask each current guest to move to the room number n*2\", is the correct answer. Here's why: if we move each current guest to a room with a number twice their current room number, we'll effectively \"shift\" all the guests to the right, freeing up room 1 for the new guest. For example, if the current guests are in rooms 1, 2, 3, ..., we'll move them to rooms 2, 4, 6, ..., respectively, leaving room 1 available for the new guest.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"26":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A runaway trolley is heading down the tracks away from five people upwards of the track.
