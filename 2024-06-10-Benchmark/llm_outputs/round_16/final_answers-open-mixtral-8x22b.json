This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them taste a small amount of wine from each bottle in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see if any prisoners die.\n4. If a prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in their group. If no prisoners die, then the poisoned bottle is not in any of the groups tested.\n5. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles and prisoners until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to narrow down the search for the poisoned bottle quickly and efficiently. By using a binary search strategy, the king can eliminate half of the remaining bottles with each test, reducing the number of tests needed to find the poisoned bottle.\n\nOption B is not a viable solution because the poison takes 24 hours to take effect, so the prisoners would not be able to identify the poisoned bottle based on taste alone.\n\nOption C is not a viable solution because it involves sacrificing the prisoners, which is not necessary to find the poisoned bottle.\n\nOption D is not a viable solution because it involves having all of the prisoners sample each of the bottles of wine, which would take too long and could result in multiple prisoners dying before the poisoned bottle is identified.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
