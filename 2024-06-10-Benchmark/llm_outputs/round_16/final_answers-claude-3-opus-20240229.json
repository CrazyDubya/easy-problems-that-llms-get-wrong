Here's how it would work:\n- Number the bottles 1 to 1000\n- Have each prisoner sample wine from specific bottles based on the binary representation of the bottle numbers\n- After 24 hours, see which prisoners have died. The binary number represented by the dead prisoners will indicate the number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example:\n- Prisoner 1 samples every bottle with a 1 in the 1's place (odd numbered bottles)\n- Prisoner 2 samples every bottle with a 1 in the 2's place (2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, etc.) \n- Prisoner 3 samples every bottle with a 1 in the 4's place (4-7, 12-15, 20-23, etc.)\n- And so on, with each prisoner responsible for sampling based on a binary digit\n\nAfter 24 hours, if prisoners 1, 4, 5 and 8 have died, that would indicate bottle number 0001010100 in binary, or 84 in decimal, is the poisoned one.\n\nThis leverages the prisoners in the most efficient way possible to cover testing 1000 bottles within the 24 hour timeframe. The other options are far less efficient and unlikely to find the poisoned bottle in time.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
