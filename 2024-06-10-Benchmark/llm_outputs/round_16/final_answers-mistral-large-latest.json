Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nD. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is to use a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. In this case, each prisoner can test a combination of bottles, and the results can be interpreted as a binary number. This way, the king can test up to 1023 bottles (2^10 - 1) in just one round of testing, which will take 24 hours.\n\nFor example, if we number the bottles from 0 to 1023, we can assign each prisoner to test a specific set of bottles. Prisoner 1 tests the bottles numbered 1, 3, 5, 7, ... (all the odd-numbered bottles), prisoner 2 tests bottles numbered 2, 3, 6, 7, ... (bottles that are multiples of 2), prisoner 3 tests bottles numbered 4, 5, 6, 7, ... (bottles that are multiples of 4), and so on. If a prisoner dies, the king knows that the poisoned bottle is one of the bottles that prisoner tested. By looking at the combination of prisoners who died, the king can identify the exact bottle number in binary.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours.\n\nReturning in JSON format:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Given the hotel is partially full and has an infinite number of rooms, finding an empty room might not be straightforward.\n\nOption C suggests moving each guest in room number n to room number n*2.
