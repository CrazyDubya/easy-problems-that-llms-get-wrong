Here's how it applies:\\n\\n1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10. Convert each prisoner's number into its binary equivalent:\\n   * Prisoner 1: 001\\n   * Prisoner 2: 010\\n   * Prisoner 3: 011\\n   * ...\\n   * Prisoner 10: 1010 \\n2. **Labeling Wine Bottles:**  Imagine each bottle of wine also has a number from 1 to 1000, each with a binary equivalent. \\n3. **Giving Wine:** Each prisoner drinks from bottles where their corresponding binary digit is a '1'. For example:\\n   * Prisoner 1 (001) drinks from bottles: 1, 9, 17, 25... (all bottles where the last binary digit is a 1)\\n   * Prisoner 2 (010) drinks from bottles: 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11... (all bottles where the second to last binary digit is a 1)\\n4. **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners die. Construct the binary number of the poisoned bottle: \\n   * If Prisoner 1 dies, the last binary digit is '1'.\\n   * If Prisoner 2 dies, the second to last binary digit is '1'.\\n   * ...and so on.\\n5. **Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 010001, which translates to 17. Bottle number 17 is poisoned.\\n\\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\\n\\n* **B:**  Tasting the poison is unreliable and dangerous. A tiny amount might not be detectable by taste but could still be lethal.\\n* **C & D:** These methods are inefficient and would lead to unnecessary deaths. You'd need far more prisoners than available to test every single bottle.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
