This is because you would need to conduct a first race with all six horses to determine the two fastest ones. Then, a second race with the two winners would determine the ultimate fastest horse, making three races in total.\n\nIn the first race, the top three horses would be selected, eliminating the slowest three. The three winners would then race head-to-head-to-head in race two, and the winner of that would race against the fourth-place finisher from the initial race. This would ensure that the horse that ultimately crosses the finish line first has indeed beaten every other horse at least once and is therefore the fastest.","score":""},"2":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a gold bar; behind the others, rotten vegetables.
