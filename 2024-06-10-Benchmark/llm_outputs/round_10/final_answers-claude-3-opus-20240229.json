The key is that the host knows what's behind each door and is intentionally offering you the option to switch to a specific door.\n\nInitially, you have a 1\/3 probability of choosing the correct door. The host then reveals a door with rotten vegetables, leaving your original choice and one other closed door.\n\nIf your original choice was correct (1\/3 chance), the host is equally likely to offer either of the other two doors, so switching would make you lose.\n\nHowever, if your original choice was incorrect (2\/3 chance), the host must offer you the door with the gold bar behind it. So by switching, you double your chances of winning from 1\/3 to 2\/3. \n\nTherefore, you should always switch doors when given the chance, as it gives you a 2\/3 probability of winning compared to 1\/3 if you stick with your original choice.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.
