If you race them all at once, you won't know which ones are the fastest if they finish in a close group.\n\nHere's how you can do it in three races:\n\n1. First, divide the horses into two groups of three and race them separately. This will give you the fastest horse from each group. Let's call them Horse A and Horse B.\n\n2. Next, race Horse A and Horse B against each other. The winner of this race is the fastest horse overall.\n\n3. However, there's still one more race needed to determine the second fastest horse. The loser of the second race (between Horse A and Horse B) could still be the second fastest if the second fastest horse from its original group is slower than the second fastest horse from the other group. So, race the second fastest horses from the original groups to find out.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of races needed is three.","score":""},"2":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a gold bar; behind the others, rotten vegetables.

There's still a 1\/3 chance that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1.\n3. The host, who knows what's behind the doors, always opens a door with rotten vegetables.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy. This strategy allows him to test multiple bottles at once, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000 (which can be represented using 10 binary digits).\n2. Assign each prisoner to one of the binary digits.\n3. If the binary digit for a prisoner is 1 for a particular bottle, have that prisoner drink from the bottle.\n4. After 24 hours, if a prisoner dies, it means that the bottles he drank from (those with a 1 in the position corresponding to his binary digit) contain the poison. If multiple prisoners die, the poisoned bottle is the one that corresponds to the binary number formed by the digits corresponding to the dead prisoners.\n\nThis method allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing, with results available in 24 hours.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
