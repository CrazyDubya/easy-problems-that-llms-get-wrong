We begin with six horses, which can be represented by the number 6 - this is 110 in binary. We need a system that will allow us to establish the fastest horse through a series of races, with the minimum number of races required. \n\nIn binary, it is possible to represent six with only three digits, and therefore, we can deduce the minimum number of races required to establish the fastest horse is three. Three races will allow us to establish the winner, as we can deduce which horse is the fastest from the results of these races.\n\nRace 1: 110 vs. 101\nRace 2: 10 vs. 01\nRace 3: 1 vs. 0\n\nThe winners of each race are represented by the binary number 1, the losers by 0.

To find the probability of two people having the same birthday, we can use the formula for combinations: C(n, r) = r!(n\u22121)! \/ r+n\u22121!. We'll assume n is the number of people and r is the number of possible birthdays. \n\nFor two people, the probability is C(n=2, r=366) = 366 * 365 \/ 2 = 66390. \n\nThe probability of no two people sharing a birthday is 365\/366, so the chance of two people having the same birthday is approximately 0.9918. \n\nTo get to a 50% chance, we'd need more than one pair of twins. Assuming each set of twins has a different birthday, we'd need about 0.4959 sets of twins, or 23 pairs, to reach the 50% probability threshold.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
