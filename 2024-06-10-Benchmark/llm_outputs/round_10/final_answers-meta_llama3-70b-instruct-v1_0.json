Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"Here's my explanation and answer:\n\nThe key to this problem is to realize that we're not looking for the probability that two specific people have the same birthday, but rather that at least two people in the room share a birthday. This is a classic problem of birthday probability.\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n\nFor a single person, the probability of having a birthday on a specific day is 1\/365. For two people, the probability that they have different birthdays is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) = 364\/365, since the second person can't have the same birthday as the first. For three people, the probability that all three have different birthdays is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) = 364 \u00d7 363 \/ 365^2.\n\nAs we add more people to the room, the probability that all of them have different birthdays decreases rapidly. To find the number of people required for at least a 50% chance of two people sharing a birthday, we can use the following formula:\n\nP(at least two people share a birthday) = 1 - P(all people have different birthdays)\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the probability for different numbers of people. It turns out that with 23 people in the room, the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is greater than 50%.\n\nNow, let's convert this to pairs of twins. Since each pair of twins must have the same birthday, we can treat each pair as a single unit. Therefore, we need 23 \"units\" (people or pairs of twins) in the room for at least a 50% chance of two people sharing a birthday. Since each pair of twins counts as one unit, we need 23\/2 = 11.5 pairs of twins. Since we can't have a fraction of a pair, we round up to the nearest whole number.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
