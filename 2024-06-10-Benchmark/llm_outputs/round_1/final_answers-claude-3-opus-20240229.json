The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nC.

By assigning each prisoner a unique combination of bottles to drink from, and interpreting the results as a 10-bit binary number, the poisoned bottle can be identified with just one round of testing that takes 24 hours. For example, prisoner 1 samples bottles 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512; prisoner 2 samples bottles 2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15,etc. After 24 hours, reading the results (alive=0, dead=1) as a binary number directly indicates the number of the poisoned bottle, e.g. 0000000010 = bottle 2, 0000001000 = bottle 8, etc. This is much faster than having prisoners divide and sample all 1000 bottles individually.\",\n  \"ANSWER\": \"C\"\n}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
