The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, offers you the chance to switch to Door No. 2. Importantly, the host's offer implies that Door No. 2 is not the door with the rotten vegetables (otherwise, the host would not offer it).\n\n3. **Switching Strategy**: If you switch to Door No. 2, you are effectively betting that the gold bar is behind one of the doors you did not initially pick. Since the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge of the doors' contents, switching increases your chances of winning.\n\n4. **Probability Analysis**:\n   - If you stick with Door No. 1, the probability of winning remains 1\/3.\n   - If you switch to Door No. 2, the probability of winning becomes 2\/3 because the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge that Door No. 2 is not a losing door.\n\nTherefore, switching to Door No. 2 gives you the highest probability of winning the gold bar.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This means there is only one empty chamber. When your opponent spins the chambers and fires at himself, he lands on the empty chamber. Now, there are five chambers left, and all of them are loaded with bullets.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, the revolver is in the same state as it was after your opponent's turn, with one empty chamber already used. This means there are five chambers left, all of which contain bullets. Therefore, if you pull the trigger without spinning, you have a 100% chance of firing a bullet.\n\nOn the other hand, if you spin the chambers again, you reset the probabilities. With five bullets and one empty chamber, the probability of landing on the empty chamber is 1\/6, or approximately 16.67%.\n\nGiven this analysis, it is clear that spinning the chambers again gives you a chance of survival, whereas not spinning guarantees that you will fire a bullet.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to spin the chambers again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"To determine how fast I would need to run back to double my average speed for the entire trip, let's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the distance to my friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_1 \\) be the time taken to walk to my friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_2 \\) be the time taken to run back.\n\n2. **Calculate Time to Walk:**\n   - I walk to my friend's house at 3 mph.\n   - Time to walk to my friend's house: \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n3. **Total Distance and Desired Average Speed:**\n   - The total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\).\n   - To double my average speed for the entire trip, the desired average speed is \\( 2 \\times 3 \\) mph = 6 mph.\n\n4. **Calculate Desired Total Time:**\n   - Desired total time for the round trip: \\( \\frac{2d}{6} = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n5. **Calculate Time to Run Back:**\n   - The total time for the round trip is the sum of the time to walk to my friend's house and the time to run back: \\( t_1 + t_2 \\).\n   - We know \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( \\frac{d}{3} + t_2 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n\n6. **Solve for \\( t_2 \\):**\n   - \\( t_2 = \\frac{d}{3} - \\frac{d}{3} = 0 \\).\n\nThis implies that to achieve an average speed of 6 mph for the entire trip, the time to run back would have to be zero, which is impossible. Therefore, I would need to run back at an infinitely fast speed.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""}}
