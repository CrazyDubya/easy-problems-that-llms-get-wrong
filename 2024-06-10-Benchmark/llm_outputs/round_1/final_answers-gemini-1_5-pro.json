It would lead to the death of all prisoners who had the misfortune of getting the poisoned bottle.\n* **B is incorrect** because the poison is stated to be tasteless, only taking effect after 24 hours.\n* **D is incorrect** because it's highly inefficient and wouldn't help pinpoint the poisoned bottle.\n\n**C is the correct answer** because it uses a binary search approach, which is the most efficient way to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10. Convert each prisoner's number into its binary equivalent (e.g., Prisoner 1 is 001, Prisoner 2 is 010, Prisoner 3 is 011, etc.).  Each digit in the binary number represents a specific wine bottle group.\n2. **Wine Assignment:** Each bottle of wine is also assigned a number from 1 to 1000.  Prisoners will sip from bottles based on their binary representation. For example:\n    * Prisoner 1 (001) drinks from bottles where the *last* binary digit is a 1.\n    * Prisoner 2 (010) drinks from bottles where the *second to last* binary digit is a 1.\n    * Prisoner 3 (011) drinks from bottles where the *last* OR *second to last* binary digit is a 1. \n    * ...and so on.\n3. **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died. Construct a binary number where '1' represents a dead prisoner and '0' represents a living prisoner. This binary number directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle number.\n\n**Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 011001, which translates to bottle number 25 (16 + 8 + 1).\n\n**Why Binary Search Works:** Binary search is highly efficient because it halves the search space with each step. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles, making it suitable for the king's situation.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
