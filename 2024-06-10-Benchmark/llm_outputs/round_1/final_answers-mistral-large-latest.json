This strategy allows him to test a large number of bottles with a minimal number of prisoners and tests.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000. Since 10 bits are required to represent numbers up to 1000, each binary number will have 10 digits. For example, the first bottle would be labeled \"0000000000\", the second \"0000000001\", the third \"0000000010\", and so on, up to the thousandth bottle \"1111101000\".\n\n2. Assign each of the 10 prisoners to one of the 10 digits in the binary numbers. For example, the first prisoner would be responsible for the first digit, the second prisoner for the second digit, and so on.\n\n3. For each test, if a digit in a bottle's binary number is 1, give a sip of that wine to the corresponding prisoner. For example, if the third bottle has the binary number \"0000000010\", only the third prisoner would take a sip from it.\n\n4. After 24 hours, check which prisoners have died. The positions of the dead prisoners in the binary number will correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle. For example, if the fourth and seventh prisoners died, the poisoned bottle would be the one labeled \"0000100100\".\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing, making it the fastest method.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is also known as a pangrammatic sentence. However, the constraint of not repeating any letter makes this task impossible in English, as most words contain repeating letters. The closest we can get is a sentence like \"Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz\" which uses every letter of the alphabet, but still has repeating letters.
