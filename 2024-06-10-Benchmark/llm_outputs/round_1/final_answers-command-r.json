Next, fill the 5-gallon jug again and pour three gallons into the now-empty 3-gallon jug. This leaves two gallons in the 5-gallon jug, which can then be transferred into the 4-gallon jug to reach the four-gallon mark.

Considering that his legs have a length, he would need to elevate himself slightly higher than the 0.5m mark to clear the hurdle. However, since we don't know the exact height of the man or his jumping technique, we can only deduce that the minimum height he could have jumped is in fact slightly higher than the 0.5m hurdle.
