The key is that the host knows what's behind the doors and always opens a door with rotten vegetables after you make your initial pick.\n\nInitially, you have a 1\/3 chance of picking the gold bar. When the host opens a door with rotten vegetables, it may seem like your odds have improved to 1\/2 for the two remaining closed doors. However, the host is constrained to always open a \"rotten vegetable\" door, so opening that door actually gives you additional information.\n\nIf you stick with your original door, your probability of winning is still 1\/3. But if you switch doors, your probability of winning increases to 2\/3. This is because switching succeeds whenever your initial pick was wrong (2\/3 probability), and staying succeeds only when your initial pick was right (1\/3 probability).\n\nTherefore, you should always switch doors when given the chance, as it doubles your probability of winning the gold bar.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD.

By treating each prisoner as a binary digit, you can represent up to 2^10 = 1024 combinations, enough to uniquely identify the poisoned bottle among 1000 bottles. For example, prisoner 1 samples bottles 1,2,4,8,16,32,etc. Prisoner 2 samples bottles 2,4,8,16,32,etc. After 24 hours, seeing which prisoners die will directly indicate the binary number of the poisoned bottle.

With one pair of twins (2 people), the probability of them having the same birthday is 100% since they are twins.\n\n2. As we add more pairs of twins to the room, the probability of at least two people having the same birthday increases.\n\n3. The birthday problem is a famous probability puzzle that states that in a room of 23 people, there is a 50.7% chance that two people have the same birthday. This is because the probability of all 23 people having different birthdays is approximately 49.3%.\n\n4. Since twins always share the same birthday, we can treat each pair of twins as a single entity in the context of the birthday problem.\n\nTherefore, if we have 23 pairs of twins in a room, it is equivalent to having 23 people with unique birthdays in the room, which leads to a probability of more than 50% that two people (or two pairs of twins) have the same birthday.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
