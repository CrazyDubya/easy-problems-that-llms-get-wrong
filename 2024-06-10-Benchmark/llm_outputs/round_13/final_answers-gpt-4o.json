The key insight here is to use a binary representation strategy.\n\nEach bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0000000000 (for bottle 1) to 1111101000 (for bottle 1000). This gives us a 10-bit binary number for each bottle, which fits perfectly with the 10 prisoners.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Assign each bottle a unique binary number from 1 to 1000.\n2. Each prisoner will represent a bit position in the binary number (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit).\n3. Have each prisoner drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit in the binary number is 1.\n   - For example, if a bottle's binary number is 1010101010, then prisoners 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 will drink from that bottle.\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners die. The combination of dead prisoners will form a binary number that corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with a single round of testing, using the binary representation of the bottle numbers and the 10 prisoners.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The birthday paradox states that in a group of 23 people, there is a better than even chance that at least two people share the same birthday. This is due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, where the number of possible pairs grows rapidly with the number of people.\n\nIn the case of twins, each pair of twins shares the same birthday.

Since each pair of twins counts as one unique birthday, we need half the number of pairs to reach the same probability threshold.\n\nThus, we need:\n\\[ n = \\frac{23}{2} \\approx 11.5 \\]\n\nSince we can't have half pairs, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 12 pairs of twins.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Slightly higher than 0.5m: This is the correct answer because it accounts for the need to clear the hurdle.\n- C. 0m: This is not possible as he needs to lift his foot to step over the hurdle.\n- D. Between 0.1m and 0.5m: This range does not include the necessary height to clear the 0.5m hurdle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"30":{"category":"Popular science","question":"I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.
