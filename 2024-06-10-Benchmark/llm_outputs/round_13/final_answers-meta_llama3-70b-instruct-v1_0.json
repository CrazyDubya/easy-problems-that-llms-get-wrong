Option A is not efficient, as it would require each prisoner to test 100 bottles of wine, which would be time-consuming and may not yield a result in 24 hours. Option B is not possible, as the poison takes effect 24 hours after consumption, so the prisoners wouldn't be able to taste the bitterness immediately. Option C is also not feasible, as it would require each prisoner to test all 1000 bottles of wine, which is impractical and wouldn't yield a result in 24 hours.\n\nThe correct answer is Option D, which uses a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle of wine with a binary number from 0 to 999 (using 10 binary digits).\n2. Divide the prisoners into two groups of 5.\n3. For each group, have them test a subset of bottles corresponding to a specific binary digit (e.g., group 1 tests bottles with a 0 in the first binary digit, and group 2 tests bottles with a 1 in the first binary digit).\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners die and which survive.\n5. Use the results to narrow down the possible poisoned bottles based on the binary digits.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 for each binary digit, using the remaining prisoners to test the remaining bottles.\n7.

This is a classic problem of birthday probability.\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity). For a single person, the probability of having a birthday on a specific day is 1\/365.\n\nNow, let's consider a group of people. For the first person, the probability of having a birthday on a specific day is 1\/365. For the second person, the probability of having a different birthday than the first person is 364\/365, since one day is already taken. For the third person, the probability of having a different birthday than the first two is 363\/365, and so on.\n\nTo find the probability that at least two people share a birthday, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability that all people have different birthdays. We can then subtract this probability from 1 to get the probability that at least two people share a birthday.\n\nUsing this approach, we can calculate the probability that at least two people share a birthday for different group sizes. It turns out that with 23 people, the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is greater than 50%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
