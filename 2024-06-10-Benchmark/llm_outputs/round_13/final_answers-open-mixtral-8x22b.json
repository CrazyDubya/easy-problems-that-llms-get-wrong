Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n\nExplanation:\nThe fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from the bottles in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoner dies.\n4. If no prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was not assigned to any prisoner.\n5. If a prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was assigned to that prisoner.\n6. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles in the group that contains the poisoned bottle.\n\nBy using this strategy, the king can identify the poisoned bottle in just 10 tests, which is the minimum number of tests needed to find the poisoned bottle among 1000 bottles.\n\nOption A is not a good choice because it would require the king to wait for 24 hours after each test, which would take too long. Option B is not a good choice because the poison is tasteless and cannot be detected by taste. Option C is not a good choice because it would require all of the prisoners to drink from all of the bottles, which would be too risky and time-consuming.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
