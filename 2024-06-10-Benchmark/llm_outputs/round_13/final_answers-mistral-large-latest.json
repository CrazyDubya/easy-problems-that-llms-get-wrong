The combined probability that the gold bar is behind either Door No. 2 or Door No. 3 is 2\/3.\n\nWhen the host reveals a door with rotten vegetables, say Door No. 3, the probability doesn't redistribute evenly between the remaining doors. The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 2 is still part of the initial 2\/3 probability that it was behind either Door No. 2 or Door No. 3.

This strategy allows him to test multiple bottles at once, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000 (which can be represented using 10 binary digits).\n2. Assign each prisoner to one of the binary digits.\n3. If the binary digit for a prisoner is 1 for a particular bottle, that prisoner will drink from that bottle.\n4. After 24 hours, the king can look at the prisoners who have died and read off the binary number that corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 2, and 8 die, the binary number would be 1010 (which corresponds to decimal number 10).\n\nThis method allows the king to test all 1000 bottles with only 10 prisoners in 24 hours.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
