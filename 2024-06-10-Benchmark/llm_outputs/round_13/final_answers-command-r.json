With one pair of twins, the likelihood of them having the same birthday is approximately 1\/365, which is far below the 50% threshold. \n\nTo get a 50\/50 chance, we'd need significantly more twins because we'd have to account for the possibility of multiple pairs' birthdays matching. Considering there are 364 potential same-birthday combinations (since the actual birthday doesn't matter, only that two people share it), we'd need 364\/365th of the chance for success, which is over 99%.\n\nEach twin pair represents two potential matches, so we'd require enough pairs to get very close to a certainty.
