Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nD.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"A\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink a small amount of wine from each bottle in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoner, if any, has been poisoned.\n4. If a prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in their group. If no one dies, then the poisoned bottle is in the remaining 900 bottles.\n5. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles and prisoners until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to narrow down the search for the poisoned bottle quickly and efficiently. It also minimizes the number of prisoners who need to be exposed to the poison.\n\nOption B is not a viable solution because it would require all prisoners to drink from all 1000 bottles, which would be time-consuming and potentially lethal. Option C is not a reliable method because the poison may not have a noticeable taste. Option D is not a viable solution because it would require all prisoners to drink from all 1000 bottles, which would be time-consuming and potentially lethal.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
