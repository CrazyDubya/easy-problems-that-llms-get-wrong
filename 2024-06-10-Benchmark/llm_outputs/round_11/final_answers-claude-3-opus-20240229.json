The key is that the host knows what's behind each door and is intentionally offering you the option to switch to a specific door.\n\nInitially, you have a 1\/3 probability of choosing the correct door. The host then reveals a door with rotten vegetables, leaving your original choice and one other closed door.\n\nIf your original choice was correct (1\/3 chance), the host is equally likely to offer either of the other two doors, so switching would make you lose.\n\nHowever, if your original choice was incorrect (2\/3 chance), the host must offer you the door with the gold bar behind it. So by switching, you double your chances of winning from 1\/3 to 2\/3. \n\nTherefore, you should always switch doors when given the chance, as it gives you a 2\/3 probability of winning compared to 1\/3 if you stick with your original choice.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Each pair of twins shares the same birthday.\n2. We need to find the number of pairs of twins that would make the probability of no two people sharing the same birthday less than or equal to 50%.\n3. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be calculated using the formula: (365 \u00d7 364 \u00d7 363 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 (365 - n + 1)) \/ 365^n, where n is the number of people in the room.\n4. Since we are dealing with pairs of twins, the number of people in the room will be twice the number of pairs.\n\nLet's try the given options:\n\nA. 1 pair (2 people): The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday is (365 \u00d7 364) \/ 365^2 \u2248 99.7%. This is greater than 50%, so 1 pair is not enough.\n\nB. 12 pairs (24 people): The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday is approximately 49.95%. This is less than 50%, so 12 pairs is sufficient.\n\nC. 46 pairs (92 people): The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday is extremely low, much less than 50%. This is more than necessary.\n\nD. 23 pairs (46 people): The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday is approximately 0.06%. This is much less than 50%, so 23 pairs is more than necessary.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 12 pairs of twins in a room would result in at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
