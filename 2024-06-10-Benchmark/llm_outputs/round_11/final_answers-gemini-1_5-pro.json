The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nD.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"A\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is A and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:** Identify one poisoned bottle out of 1000 with only 10 test subjects and a 24-hour time limit.\n\n* **Why A is Correct (Binary Search):**\n\n    1. **Number Representation:** Think of each prisoner as representing a digit in a binary number. 10 prisoners can represent numbers up to 1023 (2^10 - 1).\n\n    2. **Labeling and Assigning:**  Label each wine bottle with a number from 1 to 1000. Convert each bottle's number into its binary equivalent.  Each prisoner is assigned a 'place value' in the binary system (e.g., prisoner 1 is the ones place, prisoner 2 is the twos place, prisoner 3 is the fours place, and so on).\n\n    3. **Tasting:** A prisoner drinks from a bottle if the bottle's binary representation has a '1' in their assigned place value. For example, bottle number 5 (binary 0000000101) would be tasted by prisoners 1 and 3.\n\n    4. **Decoding the Result:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die. The binary representation of the poisoned bottle is formed by noting which prisoners died.  A '1' represents a dead prisoner, and a '0' represents a living prisoner.\n\n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n    * **B:**  This is highly inefficient and doesn't leverage the 24-hour delay information.\n    * **C:** The poison is tasteless, only identifiable by its delayed lethal effect.\n    * **D:**  Similar to B, this is inefficient and doesn't use the time delay effectively. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
