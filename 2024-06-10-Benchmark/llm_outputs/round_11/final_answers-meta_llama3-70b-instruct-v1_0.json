If one of the bulbs turns on, note the color.\n2. Turn switch A off and turn switch B on. If a different bulb turns on, note the color. If the same bulb turns on, then switch B controls the same bulb as switch A.\n3. Turn switch B off and turn switch C on. If a different bulb turns on, note the color.

Since there are 10 prisoners, we can use a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each prisoner with a unique binary number from 0 to 9 (e.g., 0000, 0001, 0010, ..., 1001).\n2. Assign each bottle of wine a unique binary number from 0 to 999 (since there are 1000 bottles).\n3. For each prisoner, have them drink from the bottles that correspond to a 1 in their binary label. For example, prisoner 0001 would drink from bottles 1, 1001, 2001, ..., 9001.\n4. Wait 24 hours and observe which prisoners die.\n5. Use the binary labels of the dead prisoners to determine which bottle is poisoned.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 0001, 0101, and 1101 die, we know that the poisoned bottle is 1101 (since it's the only bottle that all three prisoners drank from).\n\nThis strategy ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing, using all 10 prisoners.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is a classic problem of birthday probability.\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity). For a single person, the probability of having a birthday on a specific day is 1\/365.\n\nNow, let's consider a group of people. For the first person, the probability of having a birthday on a specific day is 1\/365. For the second person, the probability of having a different birthday than the first person is 364\/365, since one day is already taken. For the third person, the probability of having a different birthday than the first two is 363\/365, and so on.\n\nTo find the probability that at least two people share a birthday, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability that all people have different birthdays. We can then subtract this probability from 1 to get the probability that at least two people share a birthday.\n\nUsing this approach, we can calculate the probability that at least two people share a birthday for different group sizes.
