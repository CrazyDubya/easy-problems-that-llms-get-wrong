Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Choice**: You initially pick Door No. 1. The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, offers you to switch to Door No. 2. Importantly, the host's offer implies that Door No. 2 is not the door with the rotten vegetables (if it were, the host would not offer it).\n\n3. **Switching Strategy**: If you switch to Door No. 2, you are effectively betting that the gold bar is behind one of the two doors you did not initially pick (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3). Since the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge of the contents behind the doors, switching increases your chances of winning.\n\n4. **Probability Analysis**:\n   - If you stick with Door No. 1, your probability of winning remains 1\/3.\n   - If you switch to Door No. 2, your probability of winning becomes 2\/3 because the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge that Door No. 2 is not a losing door.\n\nTherefore, switching to Door No. 2 gives you a higher probability of winning the gold bar.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This means there is only one empty chamber. When your opponent spins the chambers and fires, he lands on the empty chamber, leaving five chambers, all but one of which are loaded.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, the revolver is in a known state: one empty chamber and five loaded chambers. Since your opponent just fired and landed on the empty chamber, the next chamber in sequence is one of the five loaded ones. Therefore, the probability of firing a bullet if you do not spin is 5\/5 or 100%.\n\nIf you spin the chambers again, you reset the probabilities. With a fresh spin, there are still six chambers, and only one is empty. Thus, the probability of landing on the empty chamber is 1\/6, or approximately 16.67%.\n\nComparing the two scenarios:\n- Not spinning: 100% chance of firing a bullet.\n- Spinning: 16.67% chance of landing on the empty chamber.\n\nClearly, spinning the chambers again gives you a better chance of survival.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"To solve the problem of identifying the poisoned bottle of wine using the 10 prisoners within 24 hours, we need to use a strategy that maximizes the information we can gather from the limited number of tests. The most efficient way to do this is by leveraging the concept of binary numbers.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0000000000 (0 in decimal) to 1111101000 (999 in decimal). This means each bottle can be uniquely identified by a 10-bit binary number.\n\n2. **Assigning Bottles to Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners can be assigned to a specific bit position in the binary representation of the bottle numbers. For example, prisoner 1 can be assigned to the least significant bit, prisoner 2 to the second least significant bit, and so on up to prisoner 10.\n\n3. **Testing Strategy**: Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit in the binary representation is 1. For instance, if a bottle's binary representation is 1010101010, prisoners 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 will drink from that bottle.\n\n4. **Interpreting Results**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, using the binary outcomes from the 10 prisoners.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"To determine how fast you would need to run back to double your average speed for the entire trip, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the distance to your friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_1 \\) be the time taken to walk to your friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_2 \\) be the time taken to run back.\n\n2. **Calculate Time to Walk:**\n   - You walk to your friend's house at 3 mph.\n   - Time to walk to your friend's house, \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n3. **Total Distance and Desired Average Speed:**\n   - The total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\).\n   - To double the average speed for the entire trip, the desired average speed is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) mph.\n\n4. **Total Time for Desired Average Speed:**\n   - The total time for the round trip to achieve an average speed of 6 mph is \\( \\frac{2d}{6} = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n5. **Calculate Time to Run Back:**\n   - The total time for the round trip is the sum of the time to walk to your friend's house and the time to run back: \\( t_1 + t_2 \\).\n   - We know \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( \\frac{d}{3} + t_2 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n\n6. **Solve for \\( t_2 \\):**\n   - Subtract \\( \\frac{d}{3} \\) from both sides: \\( t_2 = 0 \\).\n\nThis implies that you would need to run back in zero time to achieve the desired average speed, which is impossible. Therefore, you would need to run back infinitely fast.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""}}
