Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is B and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:** Identify one poisoned bottle out of 1000 with only 10 test subjects and a 24-hour time limit.\n\n* **Why A, C, and D are incorrect:**\n    * **A & D:** These methods are inefficient and overly cruel. They would lead to the death of all or most prisoners and don't guarantee finding the poisoned bottle.\n    * **C:** The poison is stated to be tasteless, only taking effect after 24 hours.\n\n* **Why B is correct (Binary Search):**\n    * **Numbering:** Imagine each prisoner represents a digit in a binary number (e.g., Prisoner 1 is the 'ones' place, Prisoner 2 is the 'twos' place, Prisoner 3 is the 'fours' place, and so on).\n    * **Wine Assignment:** Each bottle of wine is assigned a number from 1 to 1000. Convert each bottle's number into its binary equivalent.  Prisoners drink from a bottle if their corresponding binary digit is a '1'.\n    * **Example:**\n        * Bottle 5 (Binary 0000000101): Prisoners 1 and 3 would drink from this bottle.\n        * Bottle 7 (Binary 0000000111): Prisoners 1, 2, and 3 would drink from this bottle. \n    * **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die. The binary representation of the poisoned bottle is formed by noting which prisoners died.  A '1' represents a dead prisoner, and a '0' represents a living prisoner.\n\n* **Efficiency:** Binary search is highly efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles in a single round. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
