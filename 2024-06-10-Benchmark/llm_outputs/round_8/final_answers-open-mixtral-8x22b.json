What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nD. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"B\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and allows the king to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from the bottles in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoners, if any, are affected by the poison.\n4. If none of the prisoners are affected, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was not tested.\n5. If one prisoner is affected, then the poisoned bottle is in their group.\n6. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles in the affected group, dividing them into smaller groups and assigning them to the remaining prisoners.\n7. Continue this process until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle with the minimum number of tests, as each test eliminates half of the remaining possibilities. It also ensures that the poisoned bottle is identified within 24 hours, as each test takes 24 hours to complete.\n\nOption A is not the fastest way, as it only identifies the poisoned bottle after a prisoner dies. Option C is not feasible, as the poison is not detectable by taste. Option D is not practical, as it would require each prisoner to drink from all 1000 bottles, which is not possible within 24 hours.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
