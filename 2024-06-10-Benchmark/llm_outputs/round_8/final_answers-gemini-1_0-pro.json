The key to understanding it lies in recognizing that the host, by revealing an empty door (let's say No. 3), provides you with additional information. Initially, each door has a 1\/3 probability of hiding the gold bar.

Your opponent fires at himself without spinning the chambers, and the gun doesn't fire. Now, you have the choice to spin the chambers before firing at yourself.\n\nLet's analyze the situation:\n\n* **Without spinning:** If you choose not to spin the chamber, the bullet remains in the same position as before. Since the gun didn't fire when your opponent pulled the trigger, the bullet is not currently aligned with the firing pin. Therefore, the probability of the gun firing when you pull the trigger is 1\/6 (one bullet out of six chambers).\n* **With spinning:** If you choose to spin the chamber, the position of the bullet becomes random. Each chamber has an equal probability of being aligned with the firing pin, including the chamber that previously contained the bullet. Therefore, the probability of the gun firing when you pull the trigger becomes 1\/6 (one bullet out of six chambers).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs you can see, **spinning the chamber makes no difference** to the probability of the gun firing. In both cases, the probability remains 1\/6.

Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.
