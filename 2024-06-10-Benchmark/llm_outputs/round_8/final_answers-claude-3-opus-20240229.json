Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB.

Here's how it would work:\n\n1. Number the bottles from 1 to 1000 \n2. Assign each prisoner a unique 3-digit binary number from 000 to 111 (this covers 8 prisoners, the other 2 are not needed)\n3. Each prisoner samples every bottle whose number has a 1 in the same position as a 1 in their assigned binary number\n4. After 24 hours, line up the prisoners in their binary number order\n5. The positions of the sick prisoners will reveal the binary number of the poisoned bottle\n\nFor example, if prisoners 011, 101, and 110 are sick, then bottle number 0111011 (123) is poisoned.\n\nThis leverages the prisoners as \"bits\" to efficiently conduct a binary search, minimizing the number of tests needed to uniquely identify the poisoned bottle within the 24 hour time limit. The other options are far less efficient and may not find the bottle in time.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
