The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, will always offer you a chance to switch by revealing a door with rotten vegetables. In this case, the host asks if you want to pick Door No. 2 instead. This means Door No. 3 has been revealed to have rotten vegetables.\n\n3. **Switching vs. Staying**:\n   - If you **stay** with Door No. 1, your probability of winning the gold bar remains 1\/3.\n   - If you **switch** to Door No. 2, your probability of winning the gold bar increases to 2\/3. This is because the host's action of revealing a door with rotten vegetables effectively consolidates the probability of the gold bar being behind one of the other two doors into the remaining unopened door (Door No. 2).\n\nTherefore, switching to Door No. 2 gives you a higher probability of winning the gold bar.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best choice is to switch to Door No. 2.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"ANSWER\": \"A\"\n}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Given the constraints:\n\n1. One guardian always tells the truth and guards the death door.\n2. The other guardian always lies and guards the freedom door.\n\nYou can ask a single question to either guardian to determine the correct door. The key is to frame the question in such a way that it accounts for both the truth-teller and the liar.\n\nHere's the question you can ask either guardian:\n\"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would they point to?\"\n\n- If you ask the truth-teller, they will truthfully tell you that the liar would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the liar, they will lie about the truth-teller's response and also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the door they point to will be the death door.

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0 to 999 (in decimal), which corresponds to 0000000000 to 1111101000 in binary (10 bits).\n\n2. **Assigning Bottles to Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners can represent one bit in the binary number. For each bottle, if a bit is set to 1, the corresponding prisoner will drink from that bottle. For example, if bottle 5 (which is 0000000101 in binary) is being tested, prisoners 1 and 3 (counting from the right, starting at 0) will drink from it.\n\n3. **Interpreting Results**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the poisoned bottle's number.\n\nThis method ensures that we can uniquely identify any one of the 1000 bottles using just 10 prisoners, as 2^10 = 1024, which is more than enough to cover all 1000 bottles.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
