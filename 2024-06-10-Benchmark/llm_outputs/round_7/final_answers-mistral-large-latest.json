The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is to use a binary search strategy. This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number that requires no more than 10 digits (since there are 1000 bottles and 2^10 = 1024). For example, the first bottle would be 0000000001, the second 0000000010, the third 0000000011, and so on.\n\n2. Assign each prisoner to one of the binary digits. For example, the first prisoner would be responsible for the first digit, the second prisoner for the second digit, and so on.\n\n3. For each test, give each prisoner a sip of wine from each bottle where the corresponding binary digit is 1. For example, in the first test, the first prisoner would drink from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on (all bottles where the first digit is 1), the second prisoner from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, and so on (all bottles where the second digit is 1), and so on.\n\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners have died. The binary number formed by their positions will correspond to the poisoned bottle. For example, if the first and third prisoners die, the poisoned bottle would be 000000101 (the fifth bottle).\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in a single day, making it the fastest method.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is also known as a pangrammatic sentence. However, it's important to note that all the options provided reuse certain letters. For instance, 'Dogs bark with me' reuses the letter 'd', 'The five boxers jog quick' reuses several letters such as 'e', 'o', 'b', 'x', 'r', 'j', 'q', 'i', 'c', 'k', and 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' is a well-known pangram, but it also reuses several letters.
