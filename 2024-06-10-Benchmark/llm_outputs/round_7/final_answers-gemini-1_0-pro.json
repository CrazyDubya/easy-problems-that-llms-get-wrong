This approach minimizes the number of tests needed while ensuring results within the 24-hour timeframe. \n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Divide the bottles into two groups of 500 each.**\n2. **Assign each prisoner to a group.**\n3. **At the 12-hour mark, have each prisoner drink from one bottle in their assigned group.**\n4. **Observe the prisoners for the next 12 hours.**\n5. **If any prisoner dies within the 12 hours, the poisoned bottle is in their group.**\n6. **If no prisoner dies, the poisoned bottle is in the other group.**\n7. **Repeat steps 1-6 with the remaining 500 bottles, dividing them into groups of 250 and assigning prisoners accordingly.**\n8. **Continue this process, halving the number of bottles each time, until only one bottle remains.**\n\nThis method guarantees identifying the poisoned bottle within 24 hours using only 10 prisoners.

This involves calculating the probability of **not** having shared birthdays and subtracting it from 1.\n\n**Step 1: Probability of No Shared Birthdays**\n\nFor each twin pair, the probability of them not sharing a birthday is 364\/365 (since there are 364 days they could have different birthdays). Since each pair's birthdays are independent, we multiply the probabilities for each pair.\n\n**Step 2: Complementary Probability**\n\nLet \"n\" be the number of twin pairs. The probability of no shared birthdays is (364\/365)^n. To find the probability of at least one shared birthday, we subtract this from 1:\n\nP(at least one shared birthday) = 1 - (364\/365)^n\n\n**Step 3: Setting the Threshold**\n\nWe want this probability to be at least 50%:\n\n1 - (364\/365)^n \u2265 0.5\n\nSolving for n, we get:\n\nn \u2265 log(0.5) \/ log(364\/365) \u2248 22.99\n\nSince we need a whole number of pairs, we round up to n = 23.\n\n**Therefore, the answer is B. 23 pairs.**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nWith 23 pairs of twins, the probability of at least one shared birthday is approximately 50.7%.
