Here's how it would work: Label the prisoners 1 through 10 and the bottles 1 through 1000. Have prisoner 1 sample every bottle whose label has a 1 in the 1's place (1, 11, 21, ..., 991), prisoner 2 sample every bottle with a 1 in the 2's place (2, 12, 22, ..., 992), and so on. After 24 hours, line up the prisoners in their binary representation (e.g. if prisoners 1, 4, 5 and 8 die, then the binary number is 0001011001 which is 89 in decimal).

By taking action to switch the track, you would be preventing the trolley from continuing on its current path and hitting the five people. So pulling the lever has a direct positive impact on the lives of those five individuals by saving them from being killed by the oncoming trolley.\n\nHowever, the question does not specify whether there are any people on the other track that the trolley would be diverted to. If there is a person on that alternate track, then pulling the lever would result in that person's death, even though it saves the five people on the main track. This introduces an ethical dilemma around whether it is morally right to take an action that saves a greater number of lives but directly causes another person's death.\n\nLacking information about the other track, I will assume it is unoccupied.
