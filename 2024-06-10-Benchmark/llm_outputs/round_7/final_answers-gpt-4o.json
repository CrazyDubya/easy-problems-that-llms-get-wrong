In the Monty Hall problem, you initially choose one of three doors. The host, who knows what is behind each door, then opens one of the other two doors, revealing a rotten vegetable (since the host will never reveal the gold bar). You are then given the option to switch your choice to the remaining unopened door.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Choice**: When you first pick a door, you have a 1\/3 chance of picking the door with the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance of picking a door with rotten vegetables.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host will always open a door with rotten vegetables, never the gold bar. This action provides additional information.\n\n3. **Switching vs. Staying**:\n   - If you initially picked the door with the gold bar (1\/3 chance), switching will make you lose.\n   - If you initially picked a door with rotten vegetables (2\/3 chance), switching will make you win because the host's action has effectively transferred the 2\/3 probability to the remaining unopened door.\n\nTherefore, switching doors gives you a 2\/3 chance of winning the gold bar, while staying with your initial choice gives you only a 1\/3 chance.\n\nGiven the host's question, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2 instead?\" implies that the host has already opened one of the other doors to reveal rotten vegetables. Thus, switching to the remaining unopened door (in this case, door No. 2) maximizes your chances of winning.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

When your opponent fires and no bullet comes out, it means that the chamber that was fired was the one empty chamber. Now, there are 5 chambers left, and 5 bullets distributed among them.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, the next chamber to be fired is one of the remaining 5 chambers, all of which contain bullets.

The probability of firing a bullet then becomes 5\/6.\n\nComparing the two probabilities:\n- Not spinning: 100% chance of firing a bullet.\n- Spinning: 5\/6 (approximately 83.33%) chance of firing a bullet.\n\nSince 83.33% is less than 100%, it is safer to spin the chambers again.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. You know that one guardian always tells the truth and guards the death door.\n2. The other guardian always lies and guards the freedom door.\n\nYou can ask one of the guardians a single question that will help you determine the correct door. The question you should ask is:\n\n\"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would they point to?\"\n\n- If you ask the truth-telling guardian, they will truthfully tell you that the lying guardian would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the lying guardian, they will lie about the truth-telling guardian's answer and also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the door they point to is the death door. Therefore, you should choose the opposite door to ensure your safety.\n\nThus, the minimum number of questions needed to determine the door to freedom is one.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

The key insight here is to use a binary representation to leverage the 10 prisoners effectively.\n\nEach of the 1000 bottles can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is more than 1000). We can assign each bottle a binary number from 0000000000 to 1111100111 (for bottles 0 to 999).\n\nHere's the strategy:\n1. Assign each bottle a unique 10-bit binary number.\n2. Each prisoner will be responsible for one bit position in the binary number.\n3. If a bit in the binary number is 1, the corresponding prisoner will drink from that bottle. If the bit is 0, the prisoner will not drink from that bottle.\n4. After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number that corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if the poisoned bottle is number 13 (which is 0000001101 in binary), prisoners 1, 3, and 4 (counting from the right, starting at 0) will drink from it. If these prisoners die, the binary number 0000001101 will indicate that bottle 13 is poisoned.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, using the binary representation of the bottle numbers and the 10 prisoners.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"To determine how fast I would need to run back to double my average speed for the entire trip, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the distance to my friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_1 \\) be the time it takes to walk to my friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_2 \\) be the time it takes to run back.\n\n2. **Calculate Time to Walk:**\n   - Walking speed = 3 mph.\n   - Time to walk to my friend's house, \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n3. **Total Distance and Desired Average Speed:**\n   - Total distance for the round trip = \\( 2d \\).\n   - Desired average speed for the entire trip = 6 mph (double the walking speed).\n\n4. **Calculate Total Time for Desired Average Speed:**\n   - Total time for the round trip to achieve an average speed of 6 mph should be \\( \\frac{2d}{6} = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n5. **Determine Time to Run Back:**\n   - Total time for the round trip = \\( t_1 + t_2 \\).\n   - We already know \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n   - Therefore, \\( t_1 + t_2 = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n   - Since \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\), \\( t_2 \\) must be 0 hours to satisfy the equation \\( \\frac{d}{3} + t_2 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - To achieve an average speed of 6 mph for the entire trip, I would need to run back in 0 hours, which is impossible.\n   - Therefore, I would need to run back infinitely fast.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""}}
