Here's why the best choice is to switch doors:\n\n* **Initial Choice:** When you initially chose door No. 1, you had a 1\/3 chance of selecting the door with the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance of selecting a door with rotten vegetables.\n* **Host's Action:** The host *always* reveals a door with rotten vegetables behind it and *always* offers you the chance to switch. This action doesn't change the initial odds that your first door was wrong (which was 2\/3).  Crucially, the host's knowledge of where the prize is allows them to concentrate the probability of the unopened door you *didn't* pick.\n* **Switching's Advantage:** When you switch to door No. 2, you're essentially taking advantage of the concentrated 2\/3 probability that one of the doors you didn't initially pick was hiding the gold bar. \n\n**In short, always switch doors in the Monty Hall problem!** \n","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the correct answer is **B** and the reasoning behind it:\n\n* **A is incorrect** This method is highly inefficient and inhumane. It would also require each prisoner to drink from 1000 bottles, guaranteeing death for all.\n* **C is incorrect**  The poison is tasteless, as stated in the problem. The prisoners won't be able to identify it by taste.\n* **D is incorrect**  Similar to A, this method would lead to the death of all prisoners and doesn't efficiently use the 24-hour timeframe.\n\n**B is the most efficient and humane solution:**\n\n**Binary Search Strategy:**\n\n1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10. Think of these numbers in binary (1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, 1010).  Each prisoner represents a 'place value' in the binary system.\n2. **Wine Sampling:**  Each bottle of wine is also given a number from 1 to 1000.  A prisoner will take a sip from a bottle if their corresponding binary 'place value' is a '1' in the bottle's binary representation.\n   *  For example, Bottle 5 (binary 101) would be sipped by prisoners #1 and #3.\n3. **Observation:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died. Construct the binary number where a '1' represents a dead prisoner and a '0' represents a living prisoner. This binary number directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\n**Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0101000001, which converts to decimal 641. Therefore, bottle #641 is poisoned.\n\n**Why Binary Search Works:** Binary search is highly efficient for large datasets. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles, covering the entire set of 1000 bottles in a single round. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
