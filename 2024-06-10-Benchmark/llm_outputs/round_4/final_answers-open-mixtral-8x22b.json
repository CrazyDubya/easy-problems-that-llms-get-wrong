This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from the bottles in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoners, if any, are affected by the poison.\n4. If none of the prisoners are affected, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was not tested.\n5. If one prisoner is affected, then the poisoned bottle is in their group.\n6. Repeat the process with the remaining prisoners and bottles until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle with the fewest number of tests possible, using the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nOption B is not ideal because it would require the king to wait for 24 hours to see which prisoner dies, which may not be enough time to identify the poisoned bottle before the event.\n\nOption C is not feasible because it would require each prisoner to drink from all 1000 bottles, which is not possible in 24 hours.\n\nOption D is not reliable because the poison may not have a noticeable taste, and relying on taste alone may not accurately identify the poisoned bottle.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
