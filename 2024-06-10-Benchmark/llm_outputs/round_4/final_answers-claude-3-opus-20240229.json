The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"Here is my analysis:\n\nThe key constraints are that there are 1000 bottles, only 10 prisoners to test, and 24 hours to identify the poisoned bottle before the results are needed. \n\nA binary search strategy is the most efficient approach. Here's how it would work:\n- Number the bottles from 1 to 1000\n- Have each prisoner sample wine from bottles based on the binary representation of their prisoner number (1 to 10)\n- For example, prisoner 1 samples every bottle whose number has a 1 in the 1's place (odd numbered bottles). Prisoner 2 samples every bottle with a 1 in the 2's place (2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, etc). And so on up to the 10th prisoner.\n- After 24 hours, line up the prisoners in their number order. The poisoned bottle number will be revealed by taking the \"dead\" prisoners as 1's and \"alive\" prisoners as 0's. \n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 4, 5, and 9 die, then the poisoned bottle number is the binary number 1000100010 = bottle #546.\n\nThis allows testing 1000 bottles with just 10 prisoners in only 24 hours. The other options presented would either take too long or risk not finding the poisoned bottle at all.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be calculated using the formula: (365 \u00d7 364 \u00d7 363 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 (365 - n + 1)) \/ 365^n, where n is the number of people in the room.\n4.
