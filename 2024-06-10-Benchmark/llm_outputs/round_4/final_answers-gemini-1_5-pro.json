Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"A\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is A and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:** Identify one poisoned bottle out of 1000 with only 10 test subjects and a 24-hour time limit.\n\n* **Why A is Correct (Binary Search):**\n\n    1. **Number Representation:** Think of each prisoner as representing a digit in a binary number. With 10 prisoners, you can represent numbers up to 1023 (2^10 - 1).\n\n    2. **Labeling and Assigning:**\n        * Label each bottle with a number from 1 to 1000.\n        * Convert each bottle's number into its binary equivalent.\n        * Each prisoner is assigned a 'place value' in the binary system (e.g., prisoner 1 is the ones place, prisoner 2 is the twos place, prisoner 3 is the fours place, and so on).\n        * A prisoner drinks from a bottle if the bottle's binary representation has a '1' in their assigned place value.\n\n    3. **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die.  The binary representation of the poisoned bottle is formed by noting which prisoners died. For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0100101, which converts to decimal 77. Therefore, bottle number 77 is poisoned.\n\n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n    * **B:** This approach is limited to finding a maximum of 10 poisoned bottles (if all prisoners die).\n    * **C:**  This is logistically impossible \u2013 each prisoner would need to take a sip from 1000 bottles.\n    * **D:** The poison only takes effect after 24 hours, so tasting bitterness wouldn't be an immediate indicator. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The probability the next person (not their twin) has a different birthday is 364\/365. With 12 pairs of twins (24 people), we need to keep multiplying the probability of a different birthday for each additional person.\n\nHere's the calculation for 12 pairs of twins:\n\n(364\/365) * (363\/365) * ... * (342\/365) \u2248 0.499 \n\nThis means there's slightly less than a 50% chance of everyone having *different* birthdays.
