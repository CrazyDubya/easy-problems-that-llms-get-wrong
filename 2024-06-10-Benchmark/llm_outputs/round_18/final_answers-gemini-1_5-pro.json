Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"A\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the answer is A and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:** Identify one poisoned bottle out of 1000 with only 10 prisoners and 24 hours.\n* **Why A is Correct (Binary Search):**\n    * **Efficiency:** Binary search is the most efficient way to search a sorted set of data. While the bottles aren't literally sorted, we can apply the principle.\n    * **How it Works:**\n        1. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n        2. **Number the Bottles:**  Imagine each bottle numbered from 1 to 1000 in binary (up to 10 digits since 2^10 = 1024).\n        3. **Assign Wine:** Each prisoner drinks from bottles where their corresponding binary digit is a '1'.  For example:\n            * Prisoner 1: Drinks from bottles with a '1' in the rightmost binary digit (1, 3, 5, 7... 999)\n            * Prisoner 2: Drinks from bottles with a '1' in the second binary digit from the right (2, 3, 6, 7... 998, etc.) \n        4. **Observe:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners die.  Create a binary number where '1' represents a dead prisoner and '0' a living one. This binary number directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle number.\n* **Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n    * **B:**  Highly inefficient and unethical. Requires 1000 prisoners.\n    * **C:**  Only identifies the group of bottles containing the poison, not the specific bottle.\n    * **D:**  The poison takes 24 hours to work; tasting it won't help.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
