Since there are 10 prisoners, we can use a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each prisoner with a unique binary number from 0 to 9 (e.g., 0000, 0001, 0010, ..., 1001).\n2. Assign each bottle of wine a unique binary number from 0 to 999 (since there are 1000 bottles).\n3. For each prisoner, have them drink from the bottles that correspond to a 1 in their binary label. For example, prisoner 0001 would drink from bottles 1, 1001, 2001, ..., 9001.\n4. Wait 24 hours and observe which prisoners die.\n5. Use the binary labels of the dead prisoners to determine which bottle is poisoned.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 0001, 0101, and 1101 die, we know that the poisoned bottle is 1101 (since it's the only bottle that all three prisoners drank from).\n\nThis strategy ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing, using all 10 prisoners.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"Here's my explanation and answer:\n\nThe key to this problem is to realize that we're not looking for the probability that two specific people have the same birthday, but rather that at least two people in the room share a birthday. This is a classic problem of birthday probability.\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n\nFor a single person, the probability of having a birthday on any given day is 1\/365.\n\nFor two people, the probability that they have different birthdays is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) = 364\/365, since the second person can't have the same birthday as the first. The probability that they have the same birthday is therefore 1 - 364\/365 = 1\/365.\n\nNow, let's consider a room with n people. We want to find the smallest n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%.\n\nUsing the complementary probability, we can calculate the probability that all n people have different birthdays:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365) = 365! \/ (365^n \u00d7 (365-n)!)\n\nWe want this probability to be less than or equal to 50%, so we can set up the inequality:\n\n365! \/ (365^n \u00d7 (365-n)!) \u2264 0.5\n\nSolving for n, we find that n \u2265 23.\n\nTherefore, we need at least 23 people in the room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n\nSince we're looking for pairs of twins, we need 23 pairs, which is equivalent to 46 people.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

However, the key to this puzzle is to think creatively about the room assignments.\n\nIf we assume that the hotel is currently fully booked, that means every room is occupied by a guest. To accommodate one more guest, we need to free up a room. One way to do this is to ask each current guest to move to a different room. But which room?\n\nIf we ask each current guest to move to the room number n*2, we'll effectively free up all the odd-numbered rooms. Since there are an infinite number of rooms, this will create an infinite number of empty rooms, including room number 1.
