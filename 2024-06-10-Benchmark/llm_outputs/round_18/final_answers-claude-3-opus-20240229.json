With two races of 3 horses each, you'd know the fastest of each group, but not how those two compare to each other.\n\nThe minimum is three races. First, race the horses in two groups of 3.

The key is that the host knows what's behind the doors and always opens a door with rotten vegetables after you make your initial pick. \n\nWhen you first choose door 1, you have a 1\/3 chance of the gold bar being behind that door. The other 2\/3 chance is that the gold bar is behind one of the other two doors.\n\nAfter you pick door 1, the host opens another door, say door 3, to reveal rotten vegetables. The host will always open a door with rotten vegetables.\n\nNow the choice is between sticking with door 1 or switching to door 2. \n\nIf you stick with door 1, you will win if the gold bar is behind door 1, which has a 1\/3 probability.\n\nIf you switch to door 2, you will win if the gold bar was originally behind door 2 or door 3, which has a 2\/3 probability. \n\nSo by switching, you double your chances of winning from 1\/3 to 2\/3.

The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nD.

The poison may be undetectable by taste.\n\nChoice A leverages an insightful strategy. If the bottles are numbered 1 to 1000 in binary, each bottle can be uniquely identified by a 10-digit binary number, where each digit represents a prisoner. For example:\nBottle 1 = 0000000001\nBottle 2 = 0000000010\nBottle 1000 = 1111101000\n\nEach prisoner samples every bottle that has a 1 in their assigned digit. After 24 hours, the prisoners still alive correspond to 0s and dead prisoners correspond to 1s in the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nUsing this scheme, the poisoned bottle can be definitively identified out of 1000 bottles with just 10 prisoners in 24 hours.
