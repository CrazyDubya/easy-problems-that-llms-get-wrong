The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, offers you the chance to switch to Door No. 2. Importantly, the host's offer implies that Door No. 2 is not the door with rotten vegetables (otherwise, the host would not offer it).\n\n3. **Switching Strategy**: If you switch to Door No. 2, you are effectively betting that the gold bar is behind one of the two doors you did not initially pick (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3). Since the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge of the contents behind the doors, switching increases your chances of winning.\n\n4. **Probability Analysis**:\n   - If you stick with Door No. 1, your probability of winning remains 1\/3.\n   - If you switch to Door No. 2, your probability of winning increases to 2\/3 because the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge that Door No. 2 is not a losing door.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy is to switch to Door No. 2, as it gives you a higher probability of winning the gold bar.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"C\"\n}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

When your opponent fires and no bullet comes out, it means the chamber that was fired was the one empty chamber. Now, there are 5 chambers left, and 5 bullets still in the revolver.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, the next chamber to be fired is one of the remaining 5 chambers, all of which contain bullets.

The key is to frame the question in such a way that it accounts for both the truth-teller and the liar.\n\nThe question you can ask is: \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\n- If you ask the truth-teller, they will truthfully tell you that the liar would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the liar, they will lie about the truth-teller's response and also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the door they indicate will be the death door.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"To solve this problem efficiently, we need to identify the poisoned bottle using the least number of tests within the 24-hour time frame. Given that we have 10 prisoners and 1000 bottles, we can leverage the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0000000000 (0 in decimal) to 1111101000 (999 in decimal). This is because 10 binary digits (bits) can represent numbers from 0 to 1023, which is more than enough to cover 1000 bottles.\n\n2. **Assigning Bottles to Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners can be assigned to a specific bit position in the binary representation of the bottle numbers. For example, prisoner 1 can be assigned to the least significant bit, prisoner 2 to the second least significant bit, and so on up to prisoner 10.\n\n3. **Testing Strategy**: Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1. For instance, if a bottle's binary representation is 0101010101, then prisoners 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 will drink from that bottle.\n\n4. **Identifying the Poisoned Bottle**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, leveraging the binary representation and the 10 prisoners.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is due to the combinatorial probability of comparing each person's birthday with every other person's birthday.\n\nIn the case of twins, each pair of twins shares the same birthday.

Slightly higher than 0.5m\n\nThis is because, while 0.5m is the theoretical minimum, in reality, he would need to jump slightly higher to ensure he clears the hurdle.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"ANSWER\": \"A\"\n}\n```","score":""},"30":{"category":"Popular science","question":"I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.
