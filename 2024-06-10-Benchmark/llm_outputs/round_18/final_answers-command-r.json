This approach will minimize the number of tests and maximize the chances of finding the poisoned bottle within 24 hours. The concept of binary numbers can be leveraged to efficiently organize and identify the poisoned wine. Binary searching involves dividing the items into halves and progressively eliminating one side based on comparisons, which significantly reduces the search space with each iteration. \n\nIn this case, the king should first give each prisoner two bottles of wine, ensuring each bottle is unique. This can be achieved by labeling the bottles with binary numbers, where each bottle is associated with a binary digit (0 or 1).

Based on their reactions, the king can determine the binary representation of the poisoned wine. \n\nBy utilizing this approach, the number of potential bottles reduces with each iteration, eventually leading to the identification of the poisoned bottle.
