Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Each prisoner can be assigned to represent a binary digit, and the bottles can be divided into groups based on these binary numbers. By doing this, the king can test up to 1023 (2^10 - 1) bottles in just one round of testing, which will take 24 hours.\n\nFor example, if the king assigns each prisoner a binary digit from right to left (so prisoner 1 is the least significant digit and prisoner 10 is the most significant digit), and then assigns each bottle a number from 0 to 1023 in binary, he can give each prisoner a set of wines to test based on their binary assignment. If a prisoner dies, the king will know that the bottle corresponding to the binary number that includes a 1 in the position of the dead prisoner is the poisoned one.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.
