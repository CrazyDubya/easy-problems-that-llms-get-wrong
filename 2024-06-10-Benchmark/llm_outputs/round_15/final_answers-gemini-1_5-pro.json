The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the correct answer is **B** and an explanation of the strategy:\n\n* **A is incorrect (and inhumane!)**  Testing every bottle on a prisoner would lead to the death of all prisoners. \n* **C is incorrect.**  Dividing the bottles evenly still means each prisoner drinks from 100 bottles.  They would die from the cumulative poison long before 24 hours, even if only a sip was taken from each bottle.\n* **D is incorrect.** The problem states the poison is only bitter after it takes effect, which is too late.\n\n**The Solution (Binary Search):**\n\n1. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n2. **Number the Bottles:**  Assign each bottle a binary number from 0000000001 (bottle 1) to 1111101000 (bottle 1000).\n3. **Prepare the Samples:** For each bottle, each prisoner will drink a small sample ONLY if their corresponding prisoner number has a '1' in the bottle's binary representation. \n   *  For example, from bottle 5 (binary 0000000101): Prisoners 1 and 3 would drink.\n4. **Observe After 24 Hours:**  Note which prisoners die. The dead prisoners represent '1' bits, and the living prisoners represent '0' bits. Construct the binary number representing the poisoned bottle.\n\n**Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0001001001, which converts to decimal 265. Bottle 265 is poisoned.\n\n**Why this works:** Binary search is incredibly efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) possibilities, covering all 1000 bottles. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
