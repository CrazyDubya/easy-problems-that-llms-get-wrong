Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n\nExplanation:\nThe fastest way to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and allows the king to know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from one bottle in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoner, if any, was affected by the poison.\n4. If none of the prisoners were affected, then the poisoned bottle is in the remaining group of 100 bottles.\n5. If one prisoner was affected, then the poisoned bottle is in their group of 100 bottles.\n6. Repeat the process with the remaining 100 bottles, dividing them into 10 groups of 10 bottles each and assigning each group to a prisoner.\n7. Continue this process until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle with the minimum number of tests and in the shortest amount of time. It also minimizes the number of prisoners who are exposed to the poison.\n\nOption A is not a viable solution because it would require all 1000 bottles to be tested, which would take too long and expose all of the prisoners to the poison. Option C is not a viable solution because it would only identify the poisoned bottle if one of the prisoners dies, which is not guaranteed. Option D is not a viable solution because the poison is not bitter and would not be detected by taste.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
