With six horses, we can't do this in just one race, as we can only compare three horses at a time. \n\nOne approach is to divide the horses into two groups of three and race them separately.

Since the bulbs are LED and don't get warm when turned on, we can't use temperature to determine which switch controls which bulb.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, as mentioned, the bulbs don't get warm when turned on, so touching them won't provide any useful information.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because we don't need to leave the room to observe the bulbs; we can do it from where we are.\n\nOption D is not the best approach because turning all switches on at once won't give us any specific information about which switch controls which bulb.\n\nThe best approach is Option B: turning each switch on one at a time and observing the bulbs. This way, we can systematically eliminate possibilities and identify the correct switch-bulb combinations. For example, we can turn switch A on and see which bulb turns on. Then, we can turn switch A off and turn switch B on, and so on.

Option B is not feasible as it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is impractical. Options C and D are also not optimal as they don't utilize the prisoners' \"testing capacity\" efficiently.\n\nThe correct approach is to use a binary search strategy, which is option A. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle of wine with a binary number from 0 to 999 (using 10 binary digits, since 2^10 = 1024 > 1000).\n2. Assign each prisoner a unique binary number from 0 to 9 (using 4 binary digits, since 2^4 = 16 > 10).\n3. For each bottle, if the i-th binary digit is 1, the prisoner with the corresponding binary number i will drink from that bottle.\n4. After 24 hours, the king will know which prisoners have died.\n5. By analyzing the binary numbers of the dead prisoners, the king can determine the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 5 die, the king can deduce that the poisoned bottle has a binary number with the 1st, 3rd, and 5th digits set to 1. This corresponds to a unique bottle number.\n\nThis approach allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just 24 hours, using all 10 prisoners efficiently.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
