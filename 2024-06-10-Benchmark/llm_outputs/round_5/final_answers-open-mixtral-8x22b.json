This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and allows the king to find the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink a small amount of wine from each bottle in their group.\n3. Wait 24 hours to see which prisoners, if any, are affected by the poison.\n4. If none of the prisoners are affected, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was not tested.\n5. If one prisoner is affected, then the poisoned bottle is in their group.\n6. Repeat the process with the remaining prisoners and bottles until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to narrow down the search for the poisoned bottle quickly and efficiently. It also minimizes the number of prisoners who are exposed to the poison, which is important for ethical reasons.\n\nOption B is not a viable solution because it would require all of the prisoners to drink from each bottle, which would be time-consuming and potentially dangerous. Option C is not a reliable method because the poison may not have a noticeable taste. Option D is not ethical because it would require the prisoners to risk their lives unnecessarily.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
