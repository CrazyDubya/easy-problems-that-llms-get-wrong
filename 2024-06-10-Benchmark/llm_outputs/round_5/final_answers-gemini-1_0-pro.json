It's a counterintuitive problem that often leads to surprising conclusions. \n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Initial Choice:** You pick Door No. 1. \n2. **Host's Action:** The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens a different door (let's say Door No. 3) to reveal a rotten vegetable. \n3. **The Question:** Now, you have the option to switch your choice to the remaining closed door (Door No. 2) or stick with your initial choice (Door No. 1).\n\n**The key to solving this problem is understanding that the host's action provides additional information.** By revealing a door with a rotten vegetable, the host has essentially eliminated one losing option. This means that the remaining closed door now has a higher probability of hiding the gold bar.\n\nTherefore, **switching to Door No. 2 gives you the biggest advantage.** \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Initially, each door has a 1\/3 probability of having the gold bar.**\n* **After the host opens a door with a rotten vegetable, the probability shifts.** The remaining closed door now has a 2\/3 probability of having the gold bar, while your initial choice remains at 1\/3.\n* **Therefore, switching to Door No. 2 doubles your chances of winning the gold bar.**\n\n**So, the answer to the question is B.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"## The Poisoned Wine - A Strategic Solution\n\nThe king's predicament requires a clever approach to identify the poisoned bottle within the limited timeframe. Analyzing the provided options, we can determine the most efficient strategy:\n\n**A. Utilizing a Binary Search:**\n\nThis method involves assigning unique binary codes to each prisoner and a corresponding set of wine bottles. Each prisoner tastes the assigned bottles, and after 24 hours, the king observes who succumbs to the poison. Based on the pattern of deaths, the king can narrow down the poisoned bottle through a process of elimination, similar to a binary search algorithm. This approach minimizes the number of tastings required but demands meticulous organization and accurate record-keeping.\n\n**B. Mass Tasting:**\n\nThis option, while seemingly straightforward, is highly inefficient and potentially fatal. Letting all prisoners taste every bottle guarantees identifying the poisoned one, but it also guarantees the death of all prisoners within 24 hours. This outcome is unacceptable, rendering this option unsuitable.\n\n**C. Individual Tasting:**\n\nDistributing the bottles among the prisoners and relying on their taste buds to detect bitterness is unreliable. The poison might not have a distinct taste, and individual sensitivity varies. This method risks overlooking the poisoned bottle and potentially wasting precious time.\n\n**D. Divided Dosing:**\n\nThis approach offers the optimal balance between efficiency and safety. Divide the bottles into ten equal groups and assign one group to each prisoner. After 24 hours, observe which prisoner dies. The poisoned bottle is within their assigned group. This method requires only ten tastings and guarantees identifying the culprit while minimizing risk to the prisoners.\n\n**Therefore, the answer is: {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}** \n\nBy employing this divided dosing strategy, the king maximizes his chances of finding the poisoned bottle within the 24-hour timeframe while minimizing the risk to the prisoners. \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This problem calculates the probability that at least two people in a group share the same birthday.\n\nHere's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Individual Probability:** The probability of any two individuals NOT sharing a birthday is 364\/365 (as there are 364 days where birthdays don't match out of 365 total days).\n\n2. **Group Probability:** To calculate the probability of NO shared birthdays in a group of n twin pairs, we raise the individual probability to the power of n: (364\/365)^n.\n\n3. **Complementary Probability:** The probability of AT LEAST one shared birthday is the complement of the probability of NO shared birthdays. Therefore, the desired probability is 1 - (364\/365)^n.\n\n4. **Target Probability:** We want this probability to be at least 50%, which translates to 1 - (364\/365)^n >= 0.5.\n\n5. **Solving for n:** We can solve this inequality for n using trial and error or numerical methods. \n\n**Solution:** Through calculation, we find that n = 23 is the minimum number of twin pairs needed to achieve a 50% or greater chance of shared birthdays. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n``` \n","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

We also know the distance is the same for both the walk and the run. \n\nLet's assume the time walking is \"w\" and the time running is \"r\". \n\nSubstituting the values into the formula, we get:\n\n```\n12 = (2 * Distance) \/ (w + r)\n```\n\nSince the distance is the same for both the walk and the run, we can simplify the equation to:\n\n```\n12 = 2 \/ (w + r)\n```\n\nSolving for \"r\", we get:\n\n```\nr = (2 - 12w) \/ 12\n```\n\nWe want to find the speed for the run, which is:\n\n```\nSpeed = Distance \/ Time\n```\n\nSince the distance is the same for both the walk and the run, we can write:\n\n```\nSpeed = Distance \/ r\n```\n\nSubstituting the value of \"r\" from the previous equation, we get:\n\n```\nSpeed = Distance \/ ((2 - 12w) \/ 12)\n```\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n```\nSpeed = 72w \/ (2 - 12w)\n```\n\nTo find the speed that doubles the average speed of 6 mph, we need to solve the equation:\n\n```\n72w \/ (2 - 12w) = 12\n```\n\nSolving for \"w\", we get:\n\n```\nw = 1\/6\n```\n\nSubstituting this value of \"w\" back into the equation for the running speed, we get:\n\n```\nSpeed = 72 * (1\/6) \/ (2 - 12 * (1\/6))\n```\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n```\nSpeed = 6 mph\n```\n\nTherefore, you would need to run at 6 mph to double your average speed for the entire trip.\n\n## Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""}}
