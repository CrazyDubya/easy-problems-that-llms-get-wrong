Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"A\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is A and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:** Identify one poisoned bottle out of 1000 with only 10 test subjects and a 24-hour time limit.\n\n* **Why A is Correct (Binary Search):**\n\n    1. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n\n    2. **Number the Bottles:**  Imagine each bottle of wine has a number from 1 to 1000. Convert these numbers to their binary representation (e.g., bottle 1 is 0000000001, bottle 2 is 0000000010, bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.).\n\n    3. **Assign Wine Based on Binary:** Each prisoner will drink from bottles based on their corresponding binary digit. \n        * For example:\n            * Prisoner 1 drinks from every bottle where the *last* binary digit is a 1.\n            * Prisoner 2 drinks from every bottle where the *second to last* binary digit is a 1. \n            * ...and so on.\n\n    4. **Observe After 24 Hours:**  After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died.  Create a binary number where a '1' represents a dead prisoner and a '0' represents a living prisoner. This binary number directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle number.\n\n* **Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0010000101, which converts to the decimal number 525. Therefore, bottle 525 is poisoned.\n\n* **Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n    * **B:**  Impractical and unethical. It would require each prisoner to drink from 100 bottles, likely leading to alcohol poisoning or death even without the poison.\n    * **C:** The poison is tasteless, only detectable by its lethal effect after 24 hours.\n    * **D:** Similar to B, this is highly unethical and impractical. \n\n* **Efficiency:** Binary search is incredibly efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
