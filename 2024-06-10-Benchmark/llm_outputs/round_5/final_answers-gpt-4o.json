Importantly, the host's offer implies that Door No. 2 is not the door with the rotten vegetables (otherwise, the host would not offer it).\n\n3. **Switching Strategy**: If you switch to Door No. 2, you are effectively betting that the gold bar is behind one of the two doors you did not initially pick (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3). Since the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge of the doors' contents, switching increases your chances of winning.\n\n4. **Probability Analysis**:\n   - If you stick with Door No. 1, your probability of winning remains 1\/3.\n   - If you switch to Door No. 2, your probability of winning becomes 2\/3 because the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge that Door No. 2 is not a losing door.\n\nTherefore, switching to Door No. 2 gives you the highest probability of winning the gold bar.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This means there is only one empty chamber. When your opponent spins the chambers and fires, he lands on the empty chamber, leaving five chambers, all of which are loaded with bullets.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, you know that the next chamber in sequence is one of the five loaded chambers. Therefore, the probability of firing a bullet is 5 out of 5, or 100%.\n\nIf you spin the chambers again, you reset the probabilities. With a fresh spin, there are still six chambers, and five of them are loaded. The probability of landing on the empty chamber is now 1 out of 6, or approximately 16.67%.\n\nGiven these probabilities:\n- Not spinning: 100% chance of firing a bullet.\n- Spinning: 16.67% chance of landing on the empty chamber.\n\nClearly, spinning the chambers again gives you a significantly better chance of survival.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to spin the chambers again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Turning two switches on for a while, turning one off, then touching the bulbs to see which is warm and which one is on.\n- This method is not effective because the bulbs are LED and do not get warm when turned on. Therefore, you cannot rely on touch to determine which bulb is associated with which switch.\n\nB. Turning each switch on one at a time and observing the bulbs.\n- This method is effective because it allows you to directly observe which bulb lights up when each switch is turned on. By turning on each switch individually, you can clearly see which bulb is controlled by which switch.\n\nC.

The key insight here is to use a binary representation of the bottle numbers and assign each prisoner to test a specific combination of bottles.\n\nHere's the detailed reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000). For example, bottle 1 is 0000000001, bottle 2 is 0000000010, and so on up to bottle 1000.\n\n2. **Assigning Tests**: Each prisoner will be responsible for a specific bit position in the binary representation. For instance, prisoner 1 will drink from all bottles where the least significant bit (rightmost) is 1, prisoner 2 will drink from all bottles where the second least significant bit is 1, and so on.\n\n3. **Interpreting Results**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the poisoned bottle's number.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 5 die, the binary number formed is 0000001011, which corresponds to bottle number 11.\n\nGiven this strategy, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"To determine how fast you would need to run back to double your average speed for the entire trip, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the distance to your friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_1 \\) be the time taken to walk to your friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_2 \\) be the time taken to run back.\n\n2. **Calculate Time to Walk:**\n   - You walk to your friend's house at 3 mph.\n   - Time to walk to your friend's house, \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n3. **Total Distance and Desired Average Speed:**\n   - The total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\).\n   - The desired average speed for the entire trip is double the walking speed, which is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) mph.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Time for Desired Average Speed:**\n   - To achieve an average speed of 6 mph for the entire trip, the total time for the round trip should be \\( \\frac{2d}{6} = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n5. **Determine Time to Run Back:**\n   - The total time for the round trip is the sum of the time to walk to your friend's house and the time to run back: \\( t_1 + t_2 \\).\n   - We already know \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n   - Therefore, \\( \\frac{d}{3} + t_2 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n\n6. **Solve for \\( t_2 \\):**\n   - Subtract \\( \\frac{d}{3} \\) from both sides: \\( t_2 = 0 \\).\n\n7. **Interpretation:**\n   - The time to run back would have to be zero to achieve the desired average speed, which is impossible in real-world scenarios.\n\nTherefore, you would need to run back infinitely fast to double your average speed for the entire trip.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"ANSWER\": \"D\"\n}\n```","score":""}}
