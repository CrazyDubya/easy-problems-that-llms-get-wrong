The king can number the bottles from 1 to 1000 and represent each number in binary using the 10 prisoners. For example, bottle 1 would be represented as 0000000001, with each digit assigned to a prisoner. Each prisoner samples the wine from the bottles corresponding to a 1 in their assigned digit. After 24 hours, the prisoners who sampled the poisoned wine will have died. By looking at which prisoners died, the king can determine the binary number of the poisoned bottle. This allows testing 1000 bottles with just 10 prisoners in only 24 hours.\",\n  \"ANSWER\": \"A\"\n}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
