What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nD.

By treating the prisoners as bits in a binary number, you can uniquely identify up to 2^10 = 1024 bottles, which is more than enough for the 1000 bottles. For example, prisoner 1 drinks from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. Prisoner 2 drinks from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, etc. After 24 hours, seeing which prisoners have died will directly tell you the binary number of the poisoned bottle.
