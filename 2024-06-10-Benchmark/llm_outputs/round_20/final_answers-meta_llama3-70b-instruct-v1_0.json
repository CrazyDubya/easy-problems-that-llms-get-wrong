We need to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours, and we have 10 prisoners to help us.\n\nOption A is not feasible because we can't get all prisoners to sample each bottle, that would be 1000 x 10 = 10,000 tests, which is impractical.\n\nOption B is also not efficient because we would need to divide the 1000 bottles among the 10 prisoners, which means each prisoner would test around 100 bottles. If one prisoner dies, we still wouldn't know which of the 100 bottles was poisoned.\n\nOption C is not possible because the poison takes effect in 24 hours, so the prisoners wouldn't be able to taste the bitterness immediately.\n\nOption D is the correct answer. We can use a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into two groups of 500 each.\n2. Have 1 prisoner test a bottle from each group.\n3. Wait 24 hours and see which prisoner dies. If the prisoner who tested the bottle from group A dies, then the poisoned bottle is in group A. If the prisoner who tested the bottle from group B dies, then the poisoned bottle is in group B.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 with the remaining group of 500 bottles, dividing it into two groups of 250 each, and so on.\n5. After 10 rounds of testing (using all 10 prisoners), we can narrow down the search to a single bottle.\n\nThis strategy is efficient because we're using the prisoners to eliminate half of the bottles at each step, which reduces the number of tests needed exponentially.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is a classic problem of birthday probability.\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n\nFor a single person, the probability of having a birthday on any given day is 1\/365.\n\nFor two people, the probability that they have different birthdays is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) = 364\/365, since the second person can't have the same birthday as the first. The probability that they have the same birthday is therefore 1 - 364\/365 = 1\/365.\n\nNow, let's consider a room with n people. We want to find the smallest n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%.\n\nUsing the complementary probability, we can calculate the probability that all n people have different birthdays:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365) = 365! \/ (365^n \u00d7 (365-n)!)\n\nWe want this probability to be less than or equal to 50%, so we can set up the inequality:\n\n365! \/ (365^n \u00d7 (365-n)!) \u2264 0.5\n\nSolving for n, we find that n \u2265 23.\n\nTherefore, we need at least 23 people in the room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n\nSince we're asked about pairs of twins, we need 23 people, which is equivalent to 23\/2 = 11.5 pairs of twins.
