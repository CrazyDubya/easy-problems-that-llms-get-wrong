Since he makes a left turn after each leg, he is essentially walking in a square pattern.\n\nAfter the third leg, he makes another left turn and walks straight for another kilometer. Since he has been walking in a square pattern, this final leg will bring him back to his starting point horizontally. However, since he has been gaining elevation with each leg, his final elevation will be the sum of the elevation gains from each leg, which is 300m + 200m + 400m = 900m.\n\nTherefore, the man is 0m away from his starting point horizontally, but his final elevation is 900m. However, the question asks for the distance from the starting point, which would be the straight-line distance, not the horizontal distance.

This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from one bottle in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours. If none of the prisoners die, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was not tested. If one prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in their group.\n4. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles and prisoners until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to narrow down the search quickly and efficiently, as each test eliminates a large number of bottles. It also ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours, which is critical for the event.\n\nOption A is not feasible because it would require each prisoner to drink from all 1000 bottles, which is not possible in 24 hours. Option B is not optimal because it does not minimize the number of tests needed. Option C is not reliable because the poison may not have a bitter taste.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
