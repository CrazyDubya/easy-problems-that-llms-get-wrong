Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"D\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is D and how it works:\n\n* **A and B are incorrect (and highly unethical!)**  You can't ethically risk killing all or even one prisoner. \n* **C is incorrect** because the poison is only specified as deadly, not necessarily bitter.\n\n**D is the correct answer: Binary Search Strategy**\n\n1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10. Convert each prisoner's number into its binary equivalent (e.g., Prisoner 1 is 001, Prisoner 2 is 010, Prisoner 3 is 011, etc.).  Think of each digit in the binary number as representing a group of wine bottles.\n\n2. **Wine Assignment:**  Each bottle of wine is also assigned a number from 1 to 1000.  A prisoner will take a sip from a bottle if the bottle's number, when converted to binary, has a '1' in the position corresponding to the prisoner's assigned binary digit.\n\n   * **Example:** Prisoner 3 (binary 011) would sample bottles where:\n      * The *second* digit from the right in the bottle's binary number is a '1'.\n      * The *first* digit from the right in the bottle's binary number is a '1'.\n\n3. **Observation:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died. Construct a binary number where a '1' represents a dead prisoner and a '0' represents a living prisoner.\n\n4. **Identify the Poison:** This resulting binary number will directly correspond to the poisoned bottle number.\n\n**Why this works:** Binary search is highly efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles. This method ensures you can pinpoint the exact poisoned bottle within the 24-hour time limit.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
