The probability that the gold bar is behind door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (No. 2 or No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, offers you the chance to switch to door No. 2. This implies that the host is revealing some information. If the gold bar were behind door No. 3, the host would not offer you door No. 2. Therefore, the host's offer to switch to door No. 2 suggests that door No. 3 likely has rotten vegetables.\n\n3. **Switching Strategy**: Given that the host's offer to switch to door No. 2 is based on the knowledge of what is behind the doors, the probability that the gold bar is behind door No. 2 increases. The probability that the gold bar is behind door No. 2 is now 2\/3, while the probability that it is behind door No. 1 remains 1\/3.\n\nTherefore, switching to door No. 2 gives you a higher probability of winning the gold bar.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best choice is to switch to door No. 2.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

The key here is to use a method that maximizes the information we can get from the limited number of prisoners.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\nA. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\n- This is not practical because it would require each prisoner to drink from all 1000 bottles, which is not feasible.\n\nB.

Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.

By using binary numbers, we can assign each bottle a unique binary code from 0000000000 to 1111101000 (which covers 1000 bottles). Each prisoner will drink from bottles based on the binary representation of the bottle numbers. For example, prisoner 1 drinks from bottles where the least significant bit is 1, prisoner 2 drinks from bottles where the second least significant bit is 1, and so on. After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will give a unique binary number that corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most efficient and systematic method is option D.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
