If your opponent fired at themselves without spinning the chambers first, the odds of them surviving were 1 in 6. This means that one chamber is empty. \n\nIf you choose to spin the chambers, you are changing the positions of the bullets, which could increase your odds of survival from 1 in 6 to 5 in 6 (if the empty chamber ends up aligning with the barrel when you fire). However, it also introduces an element of risk: if the bullet that was previously fired at your opponent is now aligned to the barrel when you pull the trigger, it will result in your demise. \n\nGiven the risks outlined above, it's clear that not spinning the chambers is the safest option, as it keeps the status quo and doesn't increase the likelihood of a bullet being aligned with the barrel when you shoot.
