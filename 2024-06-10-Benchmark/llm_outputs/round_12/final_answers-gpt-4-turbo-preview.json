Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"This problem is a classic example of the Monty Hall problem. Here's the explanation:\n\nWhen you first pick a door (let's say door No. 1), there's a 1\/3 chance that the gold bar is behind that door, and a 2\/3 chance that it's behind one of the other two doors (either No. 2 or No. 3).\n\nWhen the host, who knows what's behind each door, offers you the chance to switch to door No. 2, it's important to note that the host's actions are based on the knowledge of where the gold bar is. If the gold bar was behind door No. 1 (your initial choice), the host could offer you to switch to door No. 2 or door No. 3 randomly because it doesn't matter (since both have rotten vegetables). However, if the gold bar was behind door No. 2 or door No. 3, the host would specifically offer the door without the gold bar (in this scenario, door No. 2, since we're considering the case where you're offered to switch to door No. 2).\n\nThis means that switching doors (to door No. 2 in this case) leverages the initial 2\/3 probability that the gold bar was not behind your first choice. Therefore, switching doors gives you a 2\/3 chance of winning the gold bar, while sticking with your initial choice (door No. 1) gives you a 1\/3 chance of winning.\n\nSo, the choice that gives you the biggest advantage is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This method involves labeling each bottle with a unique number from 1 to 1000 and then converting those numbers into their binary equivalents. Since there are 10 prisoners, we can use them to represent the 10 binary digits (bits) needed to cover numbers up to 1024 (2^10 = 1024), which is more than enough for 1000 bottles.\n\nEach prisoner will drink from bottles that have a '1' in the position of their corresponding bit. For example, if we are using prisoner 1 for the least significant bit, prisoner 2 for the next bit, and so on, prisoner 1 would drink from bottles labeled with numbers that end in a binary '1', prisoner 2 would drink from bottles with numbers that have a '1' in the second least significant bit position, and so forth.\n\nAfter 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will directly correspond to the binary number of the poisoned bottle. For instance, if prisoners 1, 3, and 5 die, the binary number formed by having '1's in the 1st, 3rd, and 5th positions (from the right) and '0's elsewhere will point to the poisoned bottle. This method ensures that the king only needs to wait 24 hours to find out exactly which bottle is poisoned without any additional rounds of testing.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The question is about doubling the average speed for the entire trip (both to and from the friend's house) compared to just the speed of walking to the friend's house.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(d\\) as the distance to the friend's house (the same distance will be covered on the way back).\n- \\(v_1 = 3\\) mph as the speed of walking to the friend's house.\n- \\(v_2\\) as the unknown speed of running back.\n- \\(T_1\\) as the time taken to walk to the friend's house.\n- \\(T_2\\) as the time taken to run back.\n\nFrom the given information, we know that \\(T_1 = \\frac{d}{v_1} = \\frac{d}{3}\\).\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is defined as the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance for the round trip is \\(2d\\), and the total time is \\(T_1 + T_2\\).\n\nWe want the average speed for the entire trip to be double the walking speed, so we want it to be \\(2 \\times 3\\) mph = \\(6\\) mph.\n\nThe formula for average speed is:\n\\[ \\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} \\]\n\nSubstituting the desired average speed and the known values, we get:\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{2d}{T_1 + T_2} \\]\n\nWe know \\(T_1 = \\frac{d}{3}\\), and we can express \\(T_2\\) as \\(T_2 = \\frac{d}{v_2}\\).\n\nSubstituting these into the equation gives:\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{3} + \\frac{d}{v_2}} \\]\n\nSimplifying, we find:\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d(3 + v_2)}{3v_2}} \\]\n\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{6v_2}{3 + v_2} \\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\(3 + v_2\\) and then by 2 to clear the denominator gives:\n\\[ 12v_2 = 18 + 6v_2 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(v_2\\) gives:\n\\[ 6v_2 = 18 \\]\n\n\\[ v_2 = 3 \\]\n\nThis result seems counterintuitive based on the setup of the problem, indicating a mistake in the manipulation. The correct approach to find the speed that would double the average speed involves recognizing that if the average speed of the entire trip is to be doubled to 6 mph, the time taken for both legs of the trip must be equal because speed is inversely proportional to time when distance is constant. Let's correct the approach:\n\nGiven the average speed for the entire trip needs to be 6 mph, and knowing that the distance doesn't change, we need to calculate the speed back based on the average speed formula and the fact that the average speed of the entire trip is the total distance divided by the total time.\n\nThe correct approach involves understanding that to double the average speed to 6 mph, the time taken to travel back must be significantly less, but the calculation provided earlier was incorrect. Let's clarify the mistake:\n\nTo actually solve this correctly, we need to recognize that the question essentially asks for an impossible scenario if we're strictly doubling the average speed in a realistic sense without reducing the time to an unrealistic amount. The mistake in the calculation led to an incorrect interpretation. \n\nDoubling the average speed of the entire trip to 6 mph, when starting with an average of 3 mph for half the trip, implies an infinite speed to make the return trip instantaneous, as any finite speed would not exactly double the average speed due to the time spent on the return trip. Therefore, the correct answer, acknowledging the conceptual mistake in the calculation, is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""}}
