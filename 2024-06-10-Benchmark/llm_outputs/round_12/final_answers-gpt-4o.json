The other guardian always lies and guards the door to freedom.\n\nYou can ask one question to either guardian that will help you determine the correct door. The key is to frame the question in such a way that it accounts for both the truth-teller and the liar.\n\nThe question you can ask is: \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would they point to?\"\n\n- If you ask the truth-teller, they will truthfully tell you that the liar would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the liar, they will lie about the truth-teller pointing to the freedom door and instead point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the door they indicate will be the death door.

Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n1. Number each of the 1000 bottles from 1 to 1000.\n2. Convert each bottle number to a 10-bit binary number (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000).\n3. Assign each bit position to a prisoner. For example, the first bit to prisoner 1, the second bit to prisoner 2, and so on up to the tenth bit to prisoner 10.\n4. Have each prisoner drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1. For instance, if bottle 5 is represented as 0000000101 in binary, then prisoner 1 and prisoner 4 will drink from bottle 5.\n5. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners die. The combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number that corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that you can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, leveraging the binary representation to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Between 0.1m and 0.5m: This range includes heights that are less than 0.5m, which would not clear the hurdle.\n- D. 0.5m: This is the exact height of the hurdle and the minimum height needed to clear it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"ANSWER\": \"D\"\n}\n```","score":""},"30":{"category":"Popular science","question":"I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.

Therefore, I would have to run back infinitely fast to achieve the desired average speed.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""}}
