First, divide the horses into two groups of three and race them separately. This will give you the fastest horse from each group. Let's call these horses A and B.\n\n2. Next, race horses A and B against each other. The winner of this race is the fastest horse overall.\n\n3. However, we still need to find the second fastest horse. This can be either the loser of the second race (between A and B) or the second-place horse from the same group as the winner of the second race. To determine this, race the second-place horses from the first two races. The winner of this race will be the second fastest horse overall if it's from the same group as the fastest horse, otherwise, the loser of the second race is the second fastest.\n\nSo, the minimum number of races needed is three.","score":""},"2":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a gold bar; behind the others, rotten vegetables.

Here's how to think about it:\n\nInitially, the probability of the gold bar being behind each door is 1\/3. When you choose a door, say Door No. 1, the probabilities don't change - there's still a 1\/3 chance that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1.\n\nHowever, the host, who knows what's behind each door, will always open a door with rotten vegetables behind it. This action provides new information that changes the probabilities. Since the host can't open Door No. 1 (your choice), they will open either Door No. 2 or Door No. 3. Let's say they open Door No. 2 and reveal rotten vegetables.\n\nNow, the probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 remains 1\/3, but the probability that it's behind Door No. 3 increases to 2\/3. This is because the host's action of opening Door No. 2 and revealing rotten vegetables effectively transfers the initial 1\/3 probability from Door No. 2 to Door No. 3.\n\nSo, after the host opens a door, you should always switch your choice to maximize your chances of winning the gold bar.\n\nHere's the answer in JSON format:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy. This strategy allows him to test a large number of bottles with a minimal number of prisoners and tests.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000. Since 10 bits are required to represent numbers up to 1000, each binary number will have 10 digits. For example, the first bottle would be labeled \"0000000000\", the second \"0000000001\", the third \"0000000010\", and so on, up to the thousandth bottle \"1111101000\".\n\n2. Assign each of the 10 prisoners to one of the 10 digits in the binary numbers. For example, the first prisoner would be responsible for the first digit, the second prisoner for the second digit, and so on.\n\n3. For each test, if a digit in a bottle's binary number is 1, give a sip of that wine to the corresponding prisoner. For example, if the third bottle has the binary number \"0000000010\", only the third prisoner would take a sip from it.\n\n4. After 24 hours, check which prisoners have died. The positions of the dead prisoners in the binary number will correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle. For example, if the fourth and seventh prisoners died, the poisoned bottle would be the one labeled \"0000100100\".\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing, making it the fastest method.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
