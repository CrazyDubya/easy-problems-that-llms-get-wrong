The slowest horse in this race is definitely not the fastest, so we can eliminate it.\n2. Take the remaining 5 horses and race 3 of them against each other. The slowest horse in this race is also not the fastest, so we can eliminate it.\n3. Now we have 4 horses left. We can race 2 of them against each other, and the winner of this race is definitely one of the top 2 fastest horses.\n4.

Since there's only one torch, two people must cross at a time. We can pair them up in different ways to find the optimal solution.\n\nLet's analyze the possible pairings:\n\n1. A and B: A takes 1 minute, B takes 2 minutes, so the total time for this pair is 2 minutes. A returns with the torch (1 minute), and then C and D cross together.\n2. A and C: A takes 1 minute, C takes 5 minutes, so the total time for this pair is 5 minutes. A returns with the torch (1 minute), and then B and D cross together.\n3. A and D: A takes 1 minute, D takes 10 minutes, so the total time for this pair is 10 minutes. A returns with the torch (1 minute), and then B and C cross together.\n\nThe fastest pairing is A and B, which takes 2 minutes. Then, A returns with the torch (1 minute), and C and D cross together. Since C takes 5 minutes and D takes 10 minutes, they will take 10 minutes to cross together.\n\nAdding up the times, we get: 2 minutes (A and B) + 1 minute (A returns) + 10 minutes (C and D) = 13 minutes.

However, we can optimize this by having B return with the torch instead of A in the third step, saving 1 minute. This brings the total time down to 18 minutes. Still not an option.\n\nLet's try again:\n\n* A and B cross together (2 minutes)\n* A returns with the torch (1 minute)\n* C and D cross together (10 minutes)\n* B returns with the torch (2 minutes)\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 = 15 minutes.

Ask one of the guardians, \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\nThink about it for a moment...\n\nIf you ask the truth-teller, they will tell you what the liar would say, which would be the wrong door.

Option A is not efficient, as it would require each prisoner to test 100 bottles of wine, which would be time-consuming and may not even guarantee a solution within 24 hours. Option B is not possible, as the poison takes effect 24 hours after consumption, so the prisoners won't be able to taste the bitterness immediately. Option D is also not feasible, as it would require each prisoner to test all 1000 bottles of wine, which is impractical and would not provide a solution within 24 hours.\n\nThe correct answer is Option C, which uses a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle of wine with a binary number from 0 to 999 (using 10 binary digits).\n2. Divide the prisoners into two groups of 5.\n3. For each group, have them test a subset of bottles corresponding to a specific binary digit (e.g., group 1 tests bottles with a 0 in the first digit, group 2 tests bottles with a 1 in the first digit).\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners die and which survive.\n5. Use the results to determine the value of each binary digit, starting from the most significant digit.\n6.

For two people, the probability that they don't share a birthday is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) = 364\/365, since the second person can't have the same birthday as the first person. For three people, the probability that they don't share a birthday is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) = 364 \u00d7 363 \/ 365^2.\n\nWe can continue this pattern to find the probability that n people don't share a birthday:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365) = 365! \/ (365^n \u00d7 (365-n)!)\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%.
