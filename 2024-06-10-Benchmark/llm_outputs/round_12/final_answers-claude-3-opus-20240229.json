By assigning each prisoner a unique combination of bottles to drink from, and interpreting the results as a 10-bit binary number, the poisoned bottle can be identified with just one round of testing that takes 24 hours. For example, prisoner 1 samples bottles 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512; prisoner 2 samples bottles 2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15,etc. After 24 hours, reading the results (alive=0, dead=1) as a binary number directly indicates the number of the poisoned bottle, e.g. 0000000010 = bottle 2, 0000001000 = bottle 8, etc. This is much faster than having prisoners divide and sample all 1000 bottles individually.\",\n  \"ANSWER\": \"C\"\n}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
