This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from one bottle in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours. If none of the prisoners die, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was not tested. If one prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in their group.\n4. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles and prisoners until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle with the minimum number of tests, which is important given the time constraint.\n\nOption A is not a viable solution because it would require all prisoners to drink from all 1000 bottles, which is not feasible in 24 hours. Option B is also not a viable solution because the poison does not have a bitter taste, so the prisoners would not be able to identify the poisoned bottle by taste alone. Option D is not a viable solution because it would require the prisoners to drink from multiple bottles, which would increase the risk of multiple prisoners dying.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
