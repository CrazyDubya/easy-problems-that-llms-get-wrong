Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"C\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the answer is C and how it works:\n\n* **A is incorrect** because it would lead to the death of all prisoners and wouldn't pinpoint the poisoned bottle.\n* **B is incorrect** because the poison is tasteless, only taking effect after 24 hours.\n* **D is incorrect** because it would lead to the death of all prisoners and wouldn't pinpoint the poisoned bottle.\n\n**C is correct: The Binary Search Strategy**\n\n1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10. Convert each prisoner's number into its binary equivalent (e.g., Prisoner 1 is 001, Prisoner 2 is 010, Prisoner 3 is 011, etc.).  Number the wine bottles from 1 to 1000 and convert each bottle number to its binary equivalent.\n\n2. **Tasting Strategy:** Each prisoner will drink from bottles based on their corresponding binary digit. For example:\n    * Prisoner 1 (001) drinks from bottles where the *last* binary digit is a 1.\n    * Prisoner 2 (010) drinks from bottles where the *second to last* binary digit is a 1.\n    * Prisoner 3 (011) drinks from bottles where the *last* binary digit is a 1 AND the *second to last* binary digit is a 1. \n\n3. **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died. Construct a binary number where:\n    * '1' represents a dead prisoner.\n    * '0' represents a living prisoner.\n\n    This binary number directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle number.\n\n**Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 011001, which translates to bottle number 25 (confirm by converting 25 to binary).\n\n**Why this works:** Binary representation allows you to test a large number of possibilities with a small number of tests. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
