With one pair of twins, the likelihood of them sharing a birthday is 1\/365. To reach a 50% chance, we'd need significantly more twins since the probability of two people having the same birthday increases as you add more pairs.\n\nTo calculate the required number of pairs, we can use the formula for combination: n!\/(r!(n\u2212r)!). In this case, we want to find the minimum n such that the probability is above 50%. With r being the number of possible birthdays, which is 365. \n\nSo, n!\/(365*(n\u2212365)) > 0.50. Solving this, we get n > 22.95, which means that we'd need at least 23 pairs of twins in the room to have a 50% chance of two people sharing a birthday.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
