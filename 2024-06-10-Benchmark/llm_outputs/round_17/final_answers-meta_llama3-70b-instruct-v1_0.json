For example, if we turn switch A on and the red bulb lights up, we know that switch A controls the red bulb.

Option A is not feasible as it would require each prisoner to test 1000 bottles, which is impractical. Option B is also not possible as the poison takes effect 24 hours after consumption, so the prisoners won't be able to taste the bitterness immediately. Option D is also not the most efficient approach as it would require each prisoner to test 100 bottles, which is still a large number.\n\nThe correct answer is Option C, which uses a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle of wine with a binary number from 0 to 999 (using 10 binary digits).\n2. Divide the prisoners into two groups of 5.\n3. For each prisoner, have them drink a mixture of wine from bottles whose binary label has a 0 in a specific position (e.g., prisoner 1 drinks a mixture of wine from bottles with a 0 in the first position, prisoner 2 drinks a mixture of wine from bottles with a 0 in the second position, and so on).\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners die. For each position in the binary label, if a prisoner dies, it means the poisoned bottle has a 1 in that position. If a prisoner lives, it means the poisoned bottle has a 0 in that position.\n5. Use the results to narrow down the possible bottles to a single one.\n\nThis approach requires only 10 tests (one for each prisoner) and can identify the poisoned bottle in 24 hours.\n\nHere's the answer in JSON format:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is a classic problem known as the \"birthday problem.\"\n\nThe probability that two people have different birthdays is 364\/365, since there are 365 possible birthdays and we're assuming that birthdays are equally likely. For three people, the probability that all three have different birthdays is (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365), since the third person can't have the same birthday as either of the first two.\n\nAs we add more people to the group, the probability that all of them have different birthdays decreases rapidly. To find the smallest number of people needed for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people share a birthday, we can use the following formula:\n\nP(at least two people share a birthday) = 1 - P(all people have different birthdays)\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the probability for different group sizes.

I walk to my friend's house at an average speed of 3mph. This means the time it takes me to walk to my friend's house is `distance \/ 3`.\n2. To double my average speed for the entire trip, I need to cover the same distance back to my starting point in half the time it took me to walk to my friend's house.\n3. Since the distance is the same, I need to run back at a speed that is twice the speed I walked at, which is 3mph. This means I need to run back at 6mph.\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer.
