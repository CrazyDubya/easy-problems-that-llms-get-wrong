When you choose a door, say Door No. 1, the probability doesn't change - it's still 1\/3. But here's the twist: the host, who knows what's behind each door, always opens another door to reveal rotten vegetables. This action provides new information that changes the probabilities.\n\nSince the host will never reveal the gold bar, the probability of the gold bar being behind the door you initially chose (Door No. 1) remains 1\/3. However, the probability of the gold bar being behind the other unopened door (Door No. 3, assuming the host opened Door No. 2) increases to 2\/3. This is because the host's action effectively consolidates the probability from the door they opened (which was 1\/3) into the other unopened door.\n\nSo, the best choice is to switch your selection to the other unopened door.\n\nHere's the answer in JSON format:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. In this case, each prisoner can be assigned to represent a binary digit, and each bottle can be represented by a unique 10-digit binary number. By giving each prisoner a sip from the bottles corresponding to their binary digit being '1' for that bottle, the king can identify the poisoned bottle based on which prisoners fall ill after 24 hours.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 7 fall ill, the king would know that the poisoned bottle is the one represented by the binary number '1010001' (counting from right to left, with the first digit representing prisoner 1 and the last digit representing prisoner 10). This method allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours, as he only needs to wait for the poison to take effect to get the results.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
