Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"A\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the answer is A and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:** Identify one poisoned bottle out of 1000 with only 10 test subjects and a 24-hour time limit.\n\n* **Why A is Correct (Binary Search):**\n\n    1. **Numbering:** Imagine each prisoner represents a digit in a binary number (Prisoner 1 = ones place, Prisoner 2 = twos place, Prisoner 3 = fours place, and so on).\n\n    2. **Wine Assignment:** Each bottle of wine is assigned a number from 1 to 1000. Convert each bottle's number into its binary equivalent.  Prisoners drink from a bottle if their corresponding binary digit is a '1' for that bottle's number. \n       *  Example: Bottle 5 (binary 0000000101) would be given to Prisoner 1 and Prisoner 3.\n\n    3. **Results:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who died represent '1' bits, and the living prisoners represent '0' bits. This forms a binary number that directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\n* **Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n    * **B:**  Highly inefficient and unethical. Requires testing all 1000 bottles simultaneously.\n    * **C:** The poison is tasteless, only detectable by its deadly effect after 24 hours.\n    * **D:**  Similar to B, this is inefficient and unethical. It also doesn't leverage the limited time frame effectively.\n\n* **Binary Search Efficiency:** Binary search allows you to test a large number of possibilities quickly. With 10 prisoners, you can represent binary numbers up to 1023 (2^10 -1), making it possible to find the poisoned bottle within the 24-hour time limit. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
