To have a 50% chance of two people having the same birthday, we need to calculate how many people are required to have a 50% chance of at least two sharing a birthday. \n\nAssuming each twin pair knows each other's birthdays, there's a 365\/366 chance that they don't share a birthday.  With this assumption, we can calculate the odds of two pairs not sharing a birthday as 365\/366 * 364\/366 = 728\/732.  Thus, the chance of two people in the room having the same birthday is 4\/732. \n\nTo get to 50%, we need more than 4\/732 * 732 = 5 people.
