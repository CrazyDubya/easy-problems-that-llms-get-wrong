Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Choice**: You initially pick Door No. 1. The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, offers you the chance to switch to Door No. 2. Importantly, the host's offer implies that Door No. 2 is not the door with the rotten vegetables (if it were, the host would not offer it).\n\n3. **Switching Strategy**: If you switch to Door No. 2, you are effectively betting that your initial choice (Door No. 1) was incorrect. Since the probability that the gold bar is behind one of the other two doors is 2\/3, and the host's offer eliminates one of those doors as a possibility, the probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 2 is now 2\/3.\n\n4. **Sticking Strategy**: If you stick with Door No. 1, the probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 remains 1\/3.\n\nTherefore, switching to Door No. 2 gives you a higher probability (2\/3) of winning the gold bar compared to sticking with Door No. 1 (1\/3).\n\nGiven this analysis, the best choice is to switch to Door No. 2.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This means there is only 1 empty chamber. When your opponent spins the chambers and fires at himself, he lands on the empty chamber, leaving 5 chambers, all of which are still loaded with bullets.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, the revolver is in the same state as it was after your opponent's turn: 1 empty chamber and 5 loaded chambers. Since your opponent did not get shot, the empty chamber is already known to be in a specific position. Therefore, if you do not spin, the probability of you landing on the empty chamber is 1 out of the remaining 5 chambers, or 1\/5 (20%).\n\nIf you spin the chambers again, you reset the probabilities. The revolver will have 6 chambers with 5 bullets, and the probability of landing on the empty chamber becomes 1\/6 (approximately 16.67%).\n\nComparing the two probabilities:\n- Not spinning: 1\/5 (20%)\n- Spinning: 1\/6 (approximately 16.67%)\n\nSince 1\/6 (16.67%) is a lower probability of landing on the empty chamber compared to 1\/5 (20%), it is safer to spin the chambers again.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to spin the chambers again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Ask either guardian the following question: \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would they point to?\"\n\n- If you ask the truth-telling guardian, they will truthfully tell you that the lying guardian would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the lying guardian, they will lie about what the truth-telling guardian would say, and thus also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the door they indicate will be the death door.

The birthday paradox states that in a group of 23 people, there is a better than even chance that at least two people share the same birthday. This is due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, where the number of possible pairs grows rapidly with the number of people.\n\nIn the case of twins, each pair of twins shares the same birthday. Therefore, if we have \\( n \\) pairs of twins, we effectively have \\( 2n \\) individuals, but with the constraint that each pair shares a birthday.\n\nTo find the number of pairs of twins needed for a 50% chance that at least two people (from different pairs) share the same birthday, we can use the same logic as the birthday paradox but adjust for the pairs.\n\nFor 23 individuals, the probability of at least two sharing a birthday is about 50%. Since each pair of twins counts as one unique birthday, we need half the number of pairs to reach the same probability threshold.\n\nThus, we need \\( \\frac{23}{2} \\approx 11.5 \\) pairs of twins.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"To determine how fast you would need to run back to double your average speed for the entire trip, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the distance to your friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_1 \\) be the time taken to walk to your friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_2 \\) be the time taken to run back.\n\n2. **Calculate Time to Walk to Friend's House:**\n   - Speed while walking = 3 mph.\n   - Time to walk to friend's house, \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n3. **Total Distance and Desired Average Speed:**\n   - Total distance for the round trip = \\( 2d \\).\n   - Desired average speed for the entire trip = \\( 2 \\times 3 \\) mph = 6 mph.\n   - Total time for the round trip to achieve this average speed = \\( \\frac{2d}{6} = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n4. **Calculate Time to Run Back:**\n   - Total time for the round trip = \\( t_1 + t_2 \\).\n   - We need \\( t_1 + t_2 = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n   - Since \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours, we have \\( \\frac{d}{3} + t_2 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n   - This implies \\( t_2 = 0 \\) hours.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - To achieve the desired average speed, the time to run back must be zero, which means you would have to run infinitely fast.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""}}
