Since there's only one torch, we need to pair people up to cross the bridge together. The key insight is that the slower person in each pair determines the crossing time.\n\nLet's analyze the possible pairings:\n\n1. A and B: A takes 1 minute, B takes 2 minutes, so together they take 2 minutes. A returns with the torch (1 minute). Total time so far: 3 minutes.\n2.

B and D: B takes 2 minutes, D takes 10 minutes, so together they take 10 minutes.\n3. C and D: C takes 5 minutes, D takes 10 minutes, so together they take 10 minutes.\n\nThe fastest option is to pair A with B, then A returns with the torch, and finally C and D cross together. This sequence takes: 2 minutes (A and B) + 1 minute (A returns) + 10 minutes (C and D) = 13 minutes.\n\nHowever, we can optimize this further. Instead of having A return with the torch, we can have B return with the torch (since B is faster than A). This saves 1 minute. The revised sequence takes: 2 minutes (A and B) + 1 minute (B returns) + 10 minutes (C and D) = 13 - 1 = 12 minutes.\n\nBut wait, there's another optimization! Since A is the fastest, we can have A cross with the torch first, then return with the torch, and finally pair B with C and D.

Option A is not the best approach because it would require each prisoner to test 100 bottles, which would be time-consuming and may not yield a result within 24 hours. Option C is not possible because the poison takes effect 24 hours after consumption, so the prisoners wouldn't be able to taste the bitterness immediately. Option D is also not feasible because it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is impractical and wouldn't yield a result within 24 hours.\n\nThe correct approach is Option B, which uses a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle of wine with a binary number from 0 to 999 (using 10 binary digits).\n2. Divide the 10 prisoners into two groups of 5.\n3. For each prisoner, have them drink a mixture of wine from bottles whose corresponding binary digit is 1. For example, prisoner 1 would drink a mixture of wine from bottles 1, 3, 5, ..., 999 (i.e., all bottles whose first binary digit is 1).\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners die. The pattern of deaths will reveal the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n5. Use the binary representation to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it uses the 10 prisoners to test multiple bottles simultaneously, and the binary search strategy reduces the number of tests needed to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

When we add a second person, the probability that they have a different birthday than the first person is 364\/365, since there's one fewer day available. The probability that they have the same birthday is therefore 1 - 364\/365 = 1\/365.\n\nNow, let's add a third person. The probability that they have a different birthday than the first two is (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365), since there are two fewer days available. The probability that they share a birthday with one of the first two people is therefore 1 - (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365).\n\nWe can continue this process, adding more people to the room and calculating the probability that they all have different birthdays. The probability that at least two people share a birthday is 1 minus the probability that they all have different birthdays.\n\nUsing this approach, we can calculate the probability that at least two people share a birthday for different numbers of people in the room. It turns out that when there are 23 people in the room, the probability that at least two people share a birthday is greater than 50%.\n\nSince we're asked to find the number of pairs of twins, we need to divide 23 by 2, which gives us 11.5 pairs. However, we can't have a fraction of a pair, so we need to round up to the nearest whole number. This means we need at least 12 pairs of twins in the room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
