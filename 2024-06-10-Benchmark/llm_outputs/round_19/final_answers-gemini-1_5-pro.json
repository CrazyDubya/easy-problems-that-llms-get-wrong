Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nD. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the answer is B and how it works:\\n\\n* **The Problem:** Identify one poisoned bottle out of 1000 with only 10 test subjects and a 24-hour time limit.\\n* **Why A, C, and D are incorrect:**\\n    * **A & D:**  These are unethical and inefficient.  You'd need many prisoners to die to find the bottle.\\n    * **C:** The poison is tasteless, only taking effect after 24 hours.\\n* **Why B is correct (Binary Search):**\\n    1. **Numbering:** Imagine each prisoner represents a place value in a binary number (e.g., Prisoner 1 = 1's place, Prisoner 2 = 2's place, Prisoner 3 = 4's place, and so on).\\n    2. **Wine Assignment:** Each bottle of wine is assigned a number from 1 to 1000. Convert each bottle's number into binary. If a bottle's binary representation has a '1' in a specific place value, the corresponding prisoner drinks from that bottle. \\n    3. **Example:**\\n        * Bottle 1 (Binary 0000000001): Only Prisoner 1 drinks.\\n        * Bottle 3 (Binary 0000000011): Prisoner 1 and Prisoner 2 drink.\\n        * Bottle 7 (Binary 0000000111): Prisoner 1, Prisoner 2, and Prisoner 3 drink. \\n    4. **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die.  Create a binary number where '1' represents a dead prisoner and '0' a living one. This binary number directly translates to the poisoned bottle number.\\n\\n* **Efficiency:** Binary search allows you to test up to 1024 (2^10) possibilities with just 10 tests, making it the most efficient solution.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
