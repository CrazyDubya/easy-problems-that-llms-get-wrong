A binary search strategy is optimal.\n\nAssign each bottle a unique 10-digit binary number (e.g. 0000000001, 0000000010, etc.). Have each prisoner sample the wines corresponding to the bottles where their \"digit\" is a 1. \n\nFor example:\nPrisoner 1 samples every bottle whose 1st digit is 1 (bottles 512-1000)\nPrisoner 2 samples every bottle whose 2nd digit is 1 (bottles 256-511, 768-1000) \nAnd so on...\n\nAfter 24 hours, the prisoners who sampled the poisoned wine will have died. The binary number represented by the dead prisoners uniquely identifies the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 4, 5, and 8 died, the poisoned bottle's number is 10011010 in binary, or bottle #154.\n\nThis requires only 1 round of testing and is guaranteed to identify the single poisoned bottle in 24 hours using the 10 prisoners.

By taking the action of pulling the lever, you would be directly intervening to rescue those five individuals from imminent mortal danger. \n\nHowever, the question does not specify whether there are any people on the other track that the trolley would be diverted to. If that track is empty, then pulling the lever is clearly the right ethical choice to save five lives. But if there are people on the other track who would be killed by the diverted trolley, then you face an ethical dilemma of whether to take an action that saves five but kills others (perhaps fewer than five or perhaps more).\n\nThis is a classic ethical thought experiment known as the \"trolley problem\" that highlights the dilemma between utilitarianism (maximizing good outcomes) and deontology (adhering to moral rules like \"don't kill\"). There is no clear universally agreed upon \"right answer.\" It depends on one's ethical framework and principles.\n\nGiven the question only asks about the impact to the five people and doesn't mention anyone else, I'll assume the other track is empty.
