The combined probability that the gold bar is behind either Door No. 2 or Door No. 3 is 2\/3.\n\nWhen the host reveals a door with rotten vegetables, say Door No. 3, the probability doesn't redistribute evenly between the remaining doors.

This strategy is based on the concept of binary numbers, where each test can be seen as a digit in a binary number. Each prisoner can test a combination of bottles, and the results can be interpreted as a binary number to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if we have 1000 bottles, we can label them from 0 to 999 in binary, which requires 10 digits (as 2^10 = 1024 > 1000). Each digit corresponds to a test for a prisoner. If a prisoner does not get sick, it means the corresponding digit is 0, and if a prisoner gets sick, it means the corresponding digit is 1.\n\nLet's say the prisoners are numbered from 1 to 10, and the bottles are labeled from 0000000000 to 1111111111 in binary. If prisoners 1, 4, and 8 get sick, it means the binary number is 1000100000, which corresponds to bottle number 512 in decimal.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of tests, with results available in 24 hours.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
