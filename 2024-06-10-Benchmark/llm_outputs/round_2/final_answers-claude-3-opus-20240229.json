Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nD. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION.

Assign each prisoner a unique binary number from 0 to 9 (e.g. 0000000001, 0000000010, etc.). For each bottle, look at the prisoner numbers in binary, and have the corresponding prisoners sample that bottle if their bit is a 1. After 24 hours, line up the prisoners in their number order - those that have died will reveal the binary number of the poisoned bottle. For example, if prisoners 2, 5 and 8 die, then the 2nd, 5th and 8th bits are 1, so the poisoned bottle number is 0010100100 in binary, or 164 in decimal. This will definitively identify the single poisoned bottle within the 24 hour time limit.\",\n  \"ANSWER\": \"A\"\n}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
