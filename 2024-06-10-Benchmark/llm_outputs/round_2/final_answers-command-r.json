Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n\nMy thinking goes as follows: if I walk at 3mph there and back, my average speed for the whole trip is 3mph. Doubling this average would give me 6mph. However, since walking and running take the same amount of time, the total time for the whole trip is dictated by the slower speed of 3mph. Therefore, to end up with an average of 6mph, I would have to run back at a speed that's faster than 6mph, because my running speed needs to make up for the slower walking speed as well.\n\nSince we're doubling the average speed, I'd need to run at a speed of 2x3mph = 6mph just to get the average we're aiming for. This is a minimum speed though; in reality, the running speed would have to be even faster than 6mph. I'd choose infinitely fast, but as this isn't an option, the next best choice is 12mph, as this allows some wiggle room to dip below that speed while still averaging 6mph over the whole trip.","score":""}}
