Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Choice**: You pick door No. 1. The probability that the gold bar is behind door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (No. 2 or No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, offers you the chance to switch to door No. 2. This implies that the host is revealing some information indirectly. If the gold bar were behind door No. 3, the host would have offered you the chance to switch to door No. 3 instead.\n\n3. **Switching Strategy**: If you switch to door No. 2, you are effectively betting that the gold bar is not behind your initial choice (door No. 1). Since the probability of the gold bar being behind one of the other two doors is 2\/3, and the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge of where the gold bar is, switching increases your chances of winning.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: By switching to door No. 2, you are leveraging the higher probability (2\/3) that the gold bar is behind one of the doors you did not initially pick.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to switch to door No. 2.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

When your opponent fires and no bullet comes out, it means the chamber that was fired was the one empty chamber. Now, there are 5 chambers left, and 5 bullets in those chambers.\n\nIf you do not spin again, the next chamber to be fired is one of the remaining 5 chambers, all of which contain bullets. Therefore, the probability of firing a bullet is 5\/5, or 100%.\n\nIf you spin the chambers again, you reset the probabilities to the initial state, where there are 6 chambers and 5 bullets. The probability of firing a bullet becomes 5\/6 again.\n\nGiven this analysis, it is clear that spinning the chambers again reduces the probability of firing a bullet from 100% to 5\/6.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to spin the chambers again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"To solve this problem efficiently, we need to leverage the 10 prisoners in a way that allows us to identify the single poisoned bottle out of 1000 within 24 hours. The key is to use a method that maximizes the information we can gather from the limited number of prisoners.\n\nThe most efficient way to do this is to use a binary representation strategy. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0000000000 (for bottle 1) to 1111101000 (for bottle 1000). This is because 1000 in binary is 1111101000, which fits within 10 bits.\n\n2. **Assigning Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners will be assigned to a specific bit position in the binary representation of the bottle numbers. For example, Prisoner 1 will be responsible for the least significant bit, Prisoner 2 for the next bit, and so on up to Prisoner 10 for the most significant bit.\n\n3. **Testing the Wine**: Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1. For instance, if a bottle's binary representation is 1010101010, then Prisoners 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 will drink from that bottle.\n\n4. **Identifying the Poisoned Bottle**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that we can uniquely identify any one of the 1000 bottles using the 10 prisoners within the 24-hour timeframe.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
