Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"A\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe most efficient way to solve this classic puzzle is using a binary search approach:\n\n* **Binary Search Strategy:**  Each prisoner represents a place value in a binary number (e.g., prisoner 1 is the ones place, prisoner 2 is the twos place, prisoner 3 is the fours place, and so on). \n* **Numbering the Bottles:** Assign each bottle of wine a number from 1 to 1000.\n* **Giving Wine Based on Binary:**  Give each prisoner a sip from bottles corresponding to a \"1\" in their binary place value. For example:\n    * Prisoner 1 drinks from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7... (all odd-numbered bottles)\n    * Prisoner 2 drinks from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11... \n    * and so on...\n* **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died.  Construct a binary number where a \"1\" represents a dead prisoner and a \"0\" represents a living prisoner. This binary number will directly correspond to the poisoned bottle number.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **B:**  The poison is tasteless, so the prisoners won't be able to identify it immediately.\n* **C & D:** These methods are highly inefficient and morally unacceptable. They would lead to the unnecessary death of most or all of the prisoners. \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
