However, you've already spent a certain amount of time walking to your friend's house. \\n* **Impossible to Make Up:** No matter how fast you run back, you can't make up for the time already spent walking. To achieve double the average speed, you'd need to return in zero time, which is impossible. \\n\\nTherefore, you would have to run back infinitely fast, which is not practically achievable.\"\n",
