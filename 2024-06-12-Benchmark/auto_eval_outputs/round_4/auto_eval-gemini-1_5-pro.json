Record the finishing order and times.\n\n**Finding the Fastest**\n\n* **The Winners:** The winners of each heat are your top contenders.\n* **The Fastest Time:** Compare the times of ALL horses across both heats. The horse with the absolute fastest time is your winner, even if they didn't win their initial heat.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Fairness:**\n    * **Rest:** Make sure the horses that race in the second heat have enough rest time to be comparable to the first heat.\n    * **Conditions:** Try to keep the track conditions as similar as possible between heats (e.g., don't water the track between races).\n* **Accuracy:**\n    * **Multiple Timers:** If possible, have multiple people timing to ensure accuracy.\n    * **Starting Point:**  Make sure the starting point is the same for each heat.\n\n**It's More Than Speed**\n\nRemember, a single race is just a snapshot.

Instead, they suggest an alternative method involving heats and timing.\n2. **Correct Thought Process**: The student's thought process is logical and aims to solve the problem of not having a six-lane track.

It makes no difference if I switch or not because no additional material information has been provided since the initial choice.","model_answer":"Yes, it's absolutely to your advantage to switch your choice. Here's why:\n\n**The Logic**\n\n* **Initial Choice:** When you initially chose door No. 1, you had a 1\/3 chance of selecting the door with the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance of selecting a door with rotten vegetables.\n* **Host's Action:** The host *knows* where the gold bar is. By opening a door with rotten vegetables, the host isn't changing the initial odds. They are concentrating the probability.\n* **The Switch:** When you switch to door No. 2, you're essentially taking advantage of the combined 2\/3 probability that the gold bar was initially behind either of the doors you *didn't* choose. \n\n**Let's break it down visually:**\n\nImagine these possible scenarios:\n\n* **Scenario 1:** Gold bar behind door No. 1\n    * You pick door No. 1.

Ask the prisoners to note which bottle tastes very bitter, this is the poisoned one.","model_answer":"Here's how the king can solve this classic puzzle:\n\n**The Strategy: Binary Coding**\n\nThe key is to think in terms of binary numbers (0s and 1s). \n\n1. **Number the Bottles:** Assign each bottle of wine a number from 1 to 1000.\n\n2. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n\n3. **Binary Representation:**  Think of each prisoner as representing a place value in a binary number (e.g., prisoner 1 is the ones place, prisoner 2 is the twos place, prisoner 3 is the fours place, and so on).\n\n4. **Wine Assignments:**  Each prisoner will drink from multiple bottles according to the binary representation of the bottle number. \n   *  If there's a \"1\" in the prisoner's corresponding binary place value for a bottle, they take a sip. \n   * If there's a \"0\", they don't.\n\n   **Example:**\n    * Bottle 5 (binary 0000001001): Prisoners 1 and 4 would drink.\n    * Bottle 12 (binary 0000011000): Prisoners 4 and 5 would drink.\n\n5. **Observation:** After 24 hours, observe which prisoners have died. The dead prisoners represent \"1s\" and the living prisoners represent \"0s\" in a binary number.\n\n6. **Decode the Binary:** Construct the binary number based on the dead\/alive prisoners. This binary number will directly correspond to the poisoned bottle number.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say prisoners 1 and 3 die. This forms the binary code 0000000101, which translates to the decimal number 5. Therefore, bottle number 5 is poisoned.\n\n**Why This Works:**\n\nThe maximum decimal number you can represent with 10 binary digits is 1023 (2^10 - 1).
