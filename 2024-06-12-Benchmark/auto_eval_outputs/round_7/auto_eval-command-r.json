This method, often known as a \"tournament,\" would pit each horse against one another in a direct competition. \n\nYou could start with three initial races, each involving four horses. The winners of these races would then compete against each other in the semi-final, and the victors of the semi-finals would advance to the final race. The horses that finish first and second in the final race can be ranked as the fastest horses, with the first-place finisher being declared the fastest of all. \n\nAn alternative method, though less optimal, would be to conduct individual time trials. Each horse would race against the clock on the same course, and their times would determine their ranking.
