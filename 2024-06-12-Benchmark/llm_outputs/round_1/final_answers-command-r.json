{"1":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have six horses and want to race them to see which is fastest. What is the best way to do this?","human_answer":"Race them on a single race track with at least six lanes - the order in which they cross the finish line determines which is the fastest.","model_answer":"The most efficient method for determining the fastest horse would be to conduct a series of head-to-head races. This method, often known as a \"tournament,\" would pit each horse against one another in a direct competition. \n\nYou could start with three initial races, each involving four horses. The winners of these races would then compete against each other in the semi-final, and the victors of the semi-finals would advance to the final race. The horses that finish first and second in the final race can be ranked as the fastest horses, with the first-place finisher being declared the fastest of all. \n\nAn alternative method, though less optimal, would be to conduct individual time trials. Each horse would race against the clock on the same course, and their times would determine their ranking. This method can be influenced by external factors such as wind speed, track conditions, or the horses' individual stamina levels at the time of racing. Therefore, the head-to-head competition is a fairer and more accurate representation of each horse's ability.","score":""},"2":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a gold bar; behind the others, rotten vegetables.

There are now two doors remaining - No. 1 (which we know has rotten vegetables behind it) and No. 2 and No. 3, which each have a 1\/2 chance of having the gold bar. \n\nSo, switching from Door No. 1 to Door No. 2 doubles your odds of winning the gold bar, as you're now choosing between the two doors with the highest probability of being correct.","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver. Your opponent puts in five bullets, spins the chambers and fires at himself, but no bullet comes out. He gives you the choice of whether or not he should spin the chambers again before firing at you. Should he spin again?","human_answer":"Yes, you should ask him to spin again. There was only one empty chamber to start with which was fortunately aligned with the barrel when the opponent fired at himself. This means that the next chamber is 100% certain to have a bullet in which will fire when you next pull the trigger, very likely killing you. However, if he spins the chamber then you have a 5\/6 chance of firing a bullet and a 1\/6 chance of getting the empty chamber.","model_answer":"As there is one bullet in the revolver, the chamber should be spun again. If the chamber is not spun, then the likelihood of the gun firing a bullet on the next trigger pull is 1\/6, however if the chamber is spun the odds shift to 1\/5. This is because the bullet is definitely not in the same position it was previously, and there is a higher chance of it being aligned with the firing pin. \n\nIt's Russian roulette, so the risk of injury or death is a given, and the additional spin will decrease the odds of an unfortunate outcome for the player passing the gun to their opponent.","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.
