Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Divide the six horses into three pairs and run three races. This will give you the three fastest horses from each pair.\n\n2. Take the winners from the first round and race them against each other in a second race. This will give you the overall fastest horse from the winners of the first round.\n\n3. Now, you have two more races to determine the second and third fastest horses. Take the horses that lost to the overall fastest horse in the first round and race them in a third race. The winner of this race is the second fastest horse.\n\n4. Finally, take the remaining horses that lost to the second fastest horse in the first round and race them in a fourth race. The winner of this race is the third fastest horse.\n\nSo, with just four races, you can determine the first, second, and third fastest horses. However, if you only want to find the single fastest horse, you can stop after the second race.","score":""},"2":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a gold bar; behind the others, rotten vegetables.
