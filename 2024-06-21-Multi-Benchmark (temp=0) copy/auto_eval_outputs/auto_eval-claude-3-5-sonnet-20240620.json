The taller guardian always tells the truth and guards the death door.\n4.

We need to test all 1000 bottles in a single round of testing, as we only have 24 hours.\n\nThe key to solving this efficiently is to use the prisoners as binary indicators. Here's how it would work:\n\n1. Number the bottles from 0 to 999.\n2. Convert each bottle number to its binary representation (10 bits can represent numbers 0-1023).\n3. Assign each prisoner to a bit position (1st prisoner = least significant bit, 10th prisoner = most significant bit).\n4.

After 24 hours, the prisoners who die will indicate the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 7 die, the poisoned bottle number in binary is 1010000010, which is 642 in decimal.\n\nThis method allows us to test all 1000 bottles in a single round, using our 10 prisoners as binary indicators, and we'll know the result in exactly 24 hours.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"47":{"level_0":47,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Bob doesn't know what's in the boxes, but we (and Colin) do.\n2. Box A will explode when opened, which is extremely dangerous.\n3. Box B contains $5, which is a small reward.\n4. Box C is empty, so opening it would be safe but yield no benefit.\n5. Since Bob doesn't know the contents, from his perspective, any box could be dangerous or beneficial.\n6. Given that one of the boxes is extremely dangerous, and the potential reward is relatively small, the safest course of action is to not open any box.\n\nThe risk of potentially opening the exploding box far outweighs the small chance of getting $5 or the neutral outcome of an empty box. Therefore, the most prudent choice for Bob is to not open any box at all.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"95":{"level_0":95,"index":6,"category":"Counting","question":"A robot has 8 arms.

Initially, there were 5 bullets in 6 chambers, giving a 5\/6 chance of firing a bullet.\n\n2. Your opponent fired and no bullet came out, which means there are now 5 bullets in the remaining 5 chambers.\n\n3. If you don't spin again, you are guaranteed to fire a bullet, as all remaining chambers contain bullets.\n\n4. If you do spin again, you're essentially resetting the odds to the initial state: 5 bullets in 6 chambers, giving you a 5\/6 chance of firing a bullet.\n\n5. A 5\/6 chance is better than a 100% chance of firing a bullet.\n\nTherefore, you should definitely spin again.

We have 1000 bottles and 10 prisoners.\n2. The poison takes effect in 24 hours, which is our time limit.\n3. We need to identify the poisoned bottle in a single test, as we only have 24 hours.\n4. Tasting for bitterness won't work because the poison is described as \"very bitter,\" not immediately detectable.\n\nThe key to solving this efficiently is to use the binary system. With 10 prisoners, we can represent 2^10 = 1024 different combinations, which is enough to cover our 1000 bottles.\n\nHere's how it would work:\n1. Assign each bottle a unique binary number from 0 to 999.\n2. Each prisoner represents a bit in this 10-digit binary number.\n3.

But the amount of nutrients absorbed is negligible compared to the overall soil mass.\n\n5. Therefore, even though the tree has grown, the soil mass remains essentially unchanged.\n\n6.

We need to determine which switch controls which bulb.\n\nThe key constraint here is that we're in the same room as the bulbs. This means we can see the immediate effect of turning any switch on or off.\n\nGiven this setup, the most straightforward and efficient method would be to turn each switch on one at a time and observe which bulb lights up. This way, we can directly associate each switch with its corresponding bulb.\n\nOption A suggests exactly this approach. It's simple, direct, and foolproof.\n\nOption B doesn't work because the bulbs are LED and don't get warm.\nOption C isn't necessary because we're already in the same room as the bulbs.\nOption D would turn all bulbs on at once, making it impossible to determine which switch controls which bulb.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is A.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"286":{"level_0":286,"index":17,"category":"Puzzle","question":"The Poisoned Wine - A king has 1000 sweet bottles of wine, and one contains a very bitter poison.

First, it's important to note that we're dealing with pairs of twins. Each pair of twins will have the same birthday.\n\n2. The classic \"Birthday Problem\" states that you need 23 people in a room for there to be a 50% chance that two people share a birthday.\n\n3. However, in this case, we're starting with pairs that already share birthdays. This significantly reduces the number of pairs we need.\n\n4. With 1 pair of twins, we have 2 people with the same birthday, but this isn't enough for a 50% chance of a match with others in the room.\n\n5. With 23 pairs (46 people), we would far exceed the 50% probability threshold, as this is equivalent to having 23 unique birthdays in the room, which gives us a 50% chance even if all birthdays were different.\n\n6. The correct answer will be less than 23 pairs but more than 1 pair.\n\n7. 12 pairs of twins means we have 12 unique birthdays represented in the room, with 24 people total.
