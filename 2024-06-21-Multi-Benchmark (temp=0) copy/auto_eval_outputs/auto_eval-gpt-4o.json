Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Choice**: You initially pick Door No. 1. The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, offers you the chance to switch to Door No. 2. Importantly, the host's offer implies that Door No. 2 is not the door with the rotten vegetables (if it were, the host would not offer it).\n\n3. **Switching Strategy**: If you switch to Door No. 2, you are effectively betting that the gold bar is behind one of the two doors you did not initially pick (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3). Since the host's offer to switch is based on knowledge of the doors' contents, switching increases your chances of winning.\n\n4. **Probability Analysis**:\n   - If you stick with Door No. 1, your probability of winning remains 1\/3.\n   - If you switch to Door No. 2, your probability of winning increases to 2\/3 because the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge that Door No. 2 is not a losing door.\n\nTherefore, switching to Door No. 2 gives you the biggest advantage.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"C\"\n}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"2":{"level_0":2,"index":3,"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This means there is only one empty chamber. When your opponent spins the chambers and fires, he lands on the empty chamber, leaving five chambers, all of which are loaded with bullets.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, you will be firing the revolver with the next chamber in sequence. Since there are five bullets and only one empty chamber, the probability that the next chamber contains a bullet is very high (5 out of 5, or 100%).\n\nIf you spin the chambers again, you reset the probabilities. With five bullets in six chambers, the probability of landing on the empty chamber is 1 out of 6, or approximately 16.67%.\n\nTherefore, spinning the chambers again gives you a better chance of survival because the probability of landing on the empty chamber is higher when you spin (1\/6) compared to not spinning (0\/5).\n\nGiven this analysis, the best choice is to spin the chambers again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"3":{"level_0":3,"index":4,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Given that the poison takes exactly 24 hours to take effect, we can use a binary representation strategy to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0 to 999 (since there are 1000 bottles). This requires 10 bits (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000).\n\n2. **Assigning Bottles to Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners will represent a bit in the binary number. For each bottle, if a bit is set to 1, the corresponding prisoner will drink from that bottle. For example, if bottle 5 is represented as 0000000101 in binary, then prisoners 1 and 3 will drink from it.\n\n3. **Identifying the Poisoned Bottle**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with the minimum number of tests and within the given time frame.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"17":{"level_0":17,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The birthday paradox states that in a group of 23 people, there is a better than even chance that at least two people share the same birthday. This is due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, where the number of possible pairs grows rapidly with the number of people.\n\nIn the case of twins, each pair of twins shares the same birthday. Therefore, if we have \\( n \\) pairs of twins, we effectively have \\( 2n \\) individuals, but with the constraint that each pair shares a birthday.\n\nTo find the number of pairs of twins needed for a 50% chance that at least two people (from different pairs) share the same birthday, we can use the same logic as the birthday paradox but adjust for the fact that each pair of twins counts as one unique birthday.\n\nFor a 50% chance of a shared birthday among \\( 2n \\) individuals, we use the birthday paradox threshold of 23 individuals. Since each pair of twins counts as one unique birthday, we need half the number of pairs to reach the same probability threshold.\n\nThus, we need:\n\\[ 23 \/ 2 = 11.5 \\]\n\nSince we can't have half a pair, we round up to the next whole number, which is 12 pairs of twins.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"24":{"level_0":24,"index":25,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Given that we have 10 prisoners and 1000 bottles, we can use a binary representation strategy to achieve this.\n\nEach bottle can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is more than 1000).

Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where the corresponding bit in the binary number is 1.\n   - For example, if bottle 5 has a binary representation of 0000000101, then prisoners 1 and 3 will drink from bottle 5.\n3.

Now, there are five chambers left, and all of them are loaded with bullets.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, you will be firing the revolver with the next chamber in sequence.

Given that we have 10 prisoners and 1000 bottles, we can use a binary representation strategy to achieve this.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is more than 1000). For example, bottle 1 can be represented as 0000000001, bottle 2 as 0000000010, and so on up to bottle 1000.\n\n2. **Assigning Tests**: Each of the 10 prisoners will be assigned a position in the 10-bit binary number. If a bit is set to 1, the corresponding prisoner will drink from that bottle. For example, if bottle 5 is represented as 0000000101, then prisoners 1 and 3 will drink from bottle 5.\n\n3. **Identifying the Poisoned Bottle**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle. For instance, if prisoners 1 and 3 die, the binary number would be 0000000101, which corresponds to bottle 5.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with a maximum of 10 tests, leveraging the binary representation of numbers.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"77":{"level_0":77,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Given that we have 10 prisoners and 1000 bottles, we can use a binary representation strategy to achieve this.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is more than enough to cover 1000 bottles).\n2. **Assigning Bottles to Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners will represent a bit position in the binary number. For example, prisoner 1 represents the least significant bit (2^0), prisoner 2 represents the next bit (2^1), and so on up to prisoner 10 who represents the most significant bit (2^9).\n3. **Testing Strategy**: For each bottle, convert its number to a 10-bit binary number. If a bit is 1, the corresponding prisoner will drink from that bottle. If a bit is 0, the prisoner will not drink from that bottle.\n4. **Identifying the Poisoned Bottle**: After 24 hours, observe which prisoners are dead. The combination of dead prisoners will form a binary number that directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle's number.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with a maximum of 10 tests, leveraging the binary representation of numbers.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"107":{"level_0":107,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"To solve the problem of identifying the poisoned bottle of wine using the 10 prisoners within 24 hours, we need to use a strategy that maximizes the information we can gather from the limited number of tests. The most efficient way to do this is to use a binary representation method.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0000000000 (0 in decimal) to 1111101000 (999 in decimal). This gives us a unique 10-bit binary number for each of the 1000 bottles.\n\n2. **Assigning Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners will represent one bit in the binary number. For example, Prisoner 1 will represent the least significant bit (2^0), Prisoner 2 will represent the next bit (2^1), and so on up to Prisoner 10 who will represent the most significant bit (2^9).\n\n3. **Testing Strategy**: Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit in the binary representation is 1. For example, if a bottle's binary representation is 0101010101, then Prisoners 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 will drink from that bottle.\n\n4. **Interpreting Results**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that we can uniquely identify the poisoned bottle using the results from the 10 prisoners.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"137":{"level_0":137,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, where the number of possible pairs grows rapidly with the number of people.\n\nIn this problem, we are dealing with pairs of twins. Each pair of twins shares the same birthday, so we can think of each pair as a single entity when considering the probability of shared birthdays.\n\nIf we have \\( n \\) pairs of twins, we effectively have \\( 2n \\) individuals. We need to find the number of pairs \\( n \\) such that the probability of at least two individuals (from the \\( 2n \\) individuals) sharing the same birthday is at least 50%.\n\nFrom the birthday paradox, we know that for 23 individuals, the probability of at least two sharing the same birthday is about 50%. Therefore, we need \\( 2n \\) to be at least 23.\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\\[ 2n \\geq 23 \\]\n\\[ n \\geq 11.5 \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer (you can't have half a pair of twins), we round up to the next whole number:\n\\[ n = 12 \\]\n\nThus, you need at least 12 pairs of twins to have a better than 50% chance that two people in the room share the same birthday.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"144":{"level_0":144,"index":25,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

The most efficient way to do this is by leveraging the concept of binary numbers.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0 to 999 (since there are 1000 bottles). This requires 10 bits (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000).\n\n2. **Assigning Bottles to Prisoners**: Each prisoner will represent a bit in the binary number. For example, prisoner 1 will represent the least significant bit (2^0), prisoner 2 will represent the next bit (2^1), and so on up to prisoner 10 who will represent the most significant bit (2^9).\n\n3. **Testing Strategy**: Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit in the binary representation is 1. For example, if a bottle is represented by the binary number 101 (which is 5 in decimal), prisoners 1 and 3 will drink from this bottle (since the binary number 101 has 1s in the positions corresponding to prisoners 1 and 3).\n\n4. **Interpreting Results**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing and within the 24-hour timeframe.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"167":{"level_0":167,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The farmer can only take one item at a time in the boat, and he must make sure to return to the original shore when necessary to prevent any of the animals or the cabbage from being left alone in a dangerous combination.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to achieve this:\n\n1. **First Crossing:** Take the goat across the river.\n   - Left shore: Wolf, Cabbage\n   - Right shore: Goat\n\n2. **Second Crossing:** Return alone to the left shore.\n   - Left shore: Wolf, Cabbage\n   - Right shore: Goat\n\n3. **Third Crossing:** Take the wolf across the river.\n   - Left shore: Cabbage\n   - Right shore: Goat, Wolf\n\n4. **Fourth Crossing:** Return with the goat to the left shore.\n   - Left shore: Goat, Cabbage\n   - Right shore: Wolf\n\n5. **Fifth Crossing:** Take the cabbage across the river.\n   - Left shore: Goat\n   - Right shore: Wolf, Cabbage\n\n6. **Sixth Crossing:** Return alone to the left shore.\n   - Left shore: Goat\n   - Right shore: Wolf, Cabbage\n\n7. **Seventh Crossing:** Take the goat across the river.\n   - Left shore: (empty)\n   - Right shore: Goat, Wolf, Cabbage\n\nBy following this sequence, the farmer ensures that at no point are the wolf and goat left alone together, nor are the goat and cabbage left alone together. Therefore, the minimum number of crossings required is seven.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"184":{"level_0":184,"index":5,"category":"Puzzle","question":"Bob has three boxes in front of him - Box A, Box B and Box C.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"To solve this problem efficiently, we need to minimize the number of tests required to identify the poisoned bottle using the 10 prisoners available. The key insight here is to use a binary representation to leverage the 10 prisoners effectively.\n\nEach prisoner can be thought of as a binary digit (bit) in a 10-bit binary number. With 10 prisoners, we can represent up to \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) different combinations, which is more than enough to cover the 1000 bottles of wine.\n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Number each bottle of wine from 1 to 1000.\n2. Convert each bottle number to its 10-bit binary equivalent.\n3. Assign each prisoner to a specific bit position (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit).\n4. For each bottle, if a bit in its binary representation is 1, the corresponding prisoner will take a sip from that bottle.\n5. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners die. The combination of dead prisoners (represented as 1s in their respective bit positions) will form a binary number that corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, using the binary representation of the bottle numbers and the 10 prisoners.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"197":{"level_0":197,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, where the number of possible pairs grows rapidly with the number of people.\n\nHowever, in this problem, we are dealing with pairs of twins. Each pair of twins shares the same birthday, so we need to adjust our calculations accordingly.\n\nLet's denote the number of pairs of twins as \\( n \\). This means there are \\( 2n \\) individuals in the room.\n\nWe need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the probability of at least two individuals (from different pairs) sharing the same birthday is at least 50%.\n\nUsing the birthday paradox formula, we know that for 23 individuals, the probability of at least two sharing the same birthday is about 50%. Therefore, we need \\( 2n \\) to be at least 23.\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\\[ 2n \\geq 23 \\]\n\\[ n \\geq 11.5 \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:\n\\[ n = 12 \\]\n\nThus, we need at least 12 pairs of twins to have a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"204":{"level_0":204,"index":25,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0000000000 (0 in decimal) to 1111101000 (999 in decimal). This is because 10 binary digits (bits) can represent numbers from 0 to 1023, which is more than enough to cover 1000 bottles.\n\n2. **Assigning Bottles to Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners will be assigned a position in the binary number (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit). For each bottle, if a bit in its binary representation is 1, the corresponding prisoner will drink from that bottle.\n\n3. **Interpreting Results**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if bottle number 5 (which is 0000000101 in binary) is poisoned, prisoners 1 and 3 (counting from the least significant bit) will die. The binary number formed by the dead prisoners will be 0000000101, which is 5 in decimal, identifying the poisoned bottle.\n\nGiven this strategy, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"227":{"level_0":227,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Your opponent has already fired one shot and survived, meaning that the chamber he fired was empty. Therefore, there are now 5 chambers left, and 4 of them contain bullets.

There are still 5 bullets in the 6 chambers, so the probability of you firing a bullet is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Number of bullets}}{\\text{Number of chambers}} = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.833 \\]\n\n### Comparison\n- Not spinning again: Probability of firing a bullet = 0.8\n- Spinning again: Probability of firing a bullet = 0.833\n\nThe probability of firing a bullet is lower if you do not spin the chambers again (0.8) compared to if you spin again (0.833).

Given that we have 10 prisoners and 1000 bottles, we can use a binary representation strategy to achieve this.\n\nEach bottle can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is more than enough to cover 1000 bottles). We can assign each prisoner to a specific bit position in the binary representation of the bottle numbers. \n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Number each bottle from 0 to 999.\n2. Convert each bottle number to its 10-bit binary equivalent.\n3. Assign each prisoner to a specific bit position (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit).\n4. Have each prisoner drink from all the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1.\n\nFor example, if bottle number 5 (which is 0000000101 in binary) is poisoned, prisoners assigned to the 1st and 3rd bits will drink from it. If both of these prisoners die, we can deduce that the poisoned bottle is number 5.\n\nThis method ensures that we can uniquely identify the poisoned bottle by observing which combination of prisoners dies, as each combination corresponds to a unique binary number.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\nD.

For each bottle, if a bit in its binary representation is 1, the corresponding prisoner will drink from that bottle.\n5. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners are dead. The combination of dead prisoners will form a binary number that corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, leveraging the binary representation and the 10 prisoners.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"287":{"level_0":287,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, where the number of possible pairs grows rapidly with the number of people.\n\nIn this problem, each pair of twins shares the same birthday, so we can treat each pair as a single entity when considering the probability of shared birthdays.

The tree grows to 3kg, which means it gains 1kg in weight.\n\nThe question implies that the tree's growth in weight comes from the nutrients and water it absorbs from the soil.
