The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is not by dividing the bottles amongst the prisoners and getting them to take a sip (Option A) because this method does not leverage the 24 hours time frame and the number of prisoners effectively. Option C is not feasible because it would result in all prisoners dying if they all consume the poisoned wine. Option D is also not correct because the poison is not immediately identifiable by taste, it takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption.\n\nThe correct approach is Option B. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, the king can leverage the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\nLabel each bottle with a unique binary number of length 10 (since there are 1000 bottles and 2^10 = 1024). For example, the first bottle would be 0000000000, the second 0000000001, and so on.\n\nEach digit in the binary number corresponds to a prisoner. If the digit is 0, the prisoner does not drink from the bottle. If the digit is 1, the prisoner does drink. This way, each prisoner drinks from a unique set of bottles.\n\nAfter 24 hours, the king can look at the prisoners who have died and their corresponding binary digits to identify the poisoned bottle. For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 8 died, the poisoned bottle would be the one labeled 1000100000 in binary.\n\nThis method allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours and is therefore the fastest way.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
