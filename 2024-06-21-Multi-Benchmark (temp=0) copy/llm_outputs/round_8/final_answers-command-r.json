As this cannot be directly applied to a number of races, we should round up to the nearest whole number, making the minimum number of races required three. \n\nThe thinking behind this is that each race will eliminate two horses, halving the number of horses remaining.

According to the paradox, only 9 people are needed for a 50% chance of a birthday match. Extrapolating this to pairs of twins, we would need twice that number, or 18 twins, in the room. Allowing for one pair of twins per birthday, there would need to be 36 halves, hence 72 people in total. As half of the twins will be identical, this equates to 23 pairs of twins.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

When the tree grows and gains weight, the mass of the soil must decrease by the same amount, as the total weight remains constant.
