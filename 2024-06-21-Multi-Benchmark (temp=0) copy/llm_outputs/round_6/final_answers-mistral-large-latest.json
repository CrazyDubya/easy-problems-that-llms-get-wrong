Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. In this case, each prisoner can be assigned to represent a binary digit, and each bottle can be represented by a unique 10-digit binary number. By giving each prisoner a sip from the bottles corresponding to their binary digit being '1' for that bottle, the king can identify the poisoned bottle based on which prisoners fall ill after 24 hours.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 7 fall ill, the king would know that the poisoned bottle is the one represented by the binary number '1010001' (counting from right to left, with the first digit representing prisoner 1 and the last digit representing prisoner 10). This method allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours, as he only needs to wait for the poison to take effect to get the results.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is because the probability increases with each additional person, as they have a chance to match their birthday with anyone already in the room.\n\nIn this case, since twins share the same birthday, each pair of twins counts as two people. So, we need enough pairs of twins to reach or exceed 23 people. Since 23 is a prime number, we would need 12 pairs of twins to have 24 people in the room, ensuring at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
