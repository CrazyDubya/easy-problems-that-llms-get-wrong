Race 1: Race all six horses together.

This doesn't change the initial probabilities. So, the probability that the gold bar is behind one of the other two doors is still 2\/3.\n\nSince one of those doors has now been revealed to have rotten vegetables, the entire 2\/3 probability shifts to the remaining unopened door.\n\nSo, switching your choice to the other unopened door gives you a 2\/3 chance of winning the gold bar, while sticking with your initial choice gives you a 1\/3 chance.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to switch to the other unopened door. However, since the question asks for the advantage between Door No.2 and Door No.3, and we don't know which one is the unopened door, the answer would be that they have equal probability if the host opens Door No.1, or one of them has an advantage if the host opens either Door No.2 or Door No.3.

Since he was at a 900m elevation before the fourth kilometer, and the elevation at his starting point is 0m, he was not at a horizontal distance of 1 km from his starting point when he started the fourth kilometer.

This strategy allows him to test multiple bottles at once and eliminate large groups of bottles in a single test. By leveraging the concept of binary numbers, the king can assign each prisoner a unique binary number, and each bottle can be represented by a combination of these binary numbers. By giving each prisoner a set of wines that correspond to their binary number, the king can identify the poisoned bottle based on which prisoners fall ill.\n\nFor example, if the prisoners are numbered from 0 to 9 in binary (0001 to 1001), and the poisoned bottle is the 11th bottle, the king would give bottles 1, 2, 4, and 8 to the first prisoner, bottles 2, 3, 6, and 9 to the second prisoner, and so on. When the first and third prisoners fall ill, the king would know that the poisoned bottle is represented by the binary number 0101, which corresponds to the 11th bottle.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in a single day, as he only needs to wait 24 hours for the poison to take effect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
