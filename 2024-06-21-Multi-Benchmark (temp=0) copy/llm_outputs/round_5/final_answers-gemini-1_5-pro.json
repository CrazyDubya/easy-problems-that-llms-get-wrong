The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"A\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is A and how it works:\\n\\n* **The Problem:** Identify one poisoned bottle out of 1000 within 24 hours.\\n* **The Constraint:**  Each prisoner can only be used once (they'll either be dead or the poison will have taken effect after one test).\\n\\n**Solution:**\\n\\n1. **Binary Representation:** Think of each prisoner as representing a place value in a binary number (e.g., prisoner 1 is the 'ones' place, prisoner 2 is the 'twos' place, prisoner 3 is the 'fours' place, and so on). Since 2^10 = 1024, you can represent numbers up to 1023 using 10 prisoners.\\n\\n2. **Number the Bottles:** Assign each bottle of wine a number from 1 to 1000.\\n\\n3. **Prepare the Samples:** For each bottle, give a tiny sample to the prisoners whose corresponding binary place value is a '1' in the bottle's binary representation. For example:\\n    * Bottle 1 (binary 0000000001): Only prisoner 1 drinks from this bottle.\\n    * Bottle 5 (binary 0000000101): Prisoners 1 and 3 drink from this bottle.\\n    * Bottle 8 (binary 0000001000): Only prisoner 4 drinks from this bottle.\\n\\n4. **Observe After 24 Hours:**  The prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die. The binary representation of the poisoned bottle's number will be formed by noting which prisoners died. For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0000010101, which converts to decimal 85 \u2013 bottle number 85 was poisoned.\\n\\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\\n\\n* **B:**  Tasting the poison might not be lethal, but it's unreliable. The poison could have a delayed reaction or a very subtle taste.\\n* **C & D:**  These methods are incredibly inefficient and don't leverage the time constraint effectively. You'll likely lose all your prisoners without finding the poisoned bottle.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
