Assign each bottle a unique 10-digit binary number, where each digit corresponds to a prisoner. Have each prisoner sample the bottles where their digit is a 1. After 24 hours, line up the prisoners in their digit order - the binary number represented by the sick\/dead prisoners will identify the poisoned bottle.
