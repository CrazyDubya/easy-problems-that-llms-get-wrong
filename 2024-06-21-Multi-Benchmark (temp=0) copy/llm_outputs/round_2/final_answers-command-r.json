With two people in the room, the chance of them having the same birthday is 1\/365 x 1\/365, or 1\/133,225.\n\nTo get this probability up to 50%, we need more people. The formula for combinations is C(n, r) = n! \/ (r! * (n\u2212r)!), which gives the number of different r-element subsets that can be chosen from a set of n elements. Using this formula, we can calculate that there are 23,114,199 different pairs that could be chosen from 46 people. At this point, the probability of two people having the same birthday is 199\/23,114,199, or approximately 0.86%, which exceeds 50%.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

We'll fill up the 5-gallon jug, which holds more than 4 gallons, and then carefully pour its contents into the 3-gallon jug until the 3-gallon jug is full. This will give us exactly 3 gallons of water in the 3-gallon jug, with the remaining 2 gallons left in the 5-gallon jug. \n\nWe then refill the 5-gallon jug, and this time pour the excess water from the 5-gallon jug into the 3-gallon jug until it's overflowing. This will result in the 3-gallon jug having 4 gallons of water, which can be checked by pouring it into the 4-gallon jug to see it fill up exactly. \n\nSo the process is: fill the 5-gallon jug, fill the 3-gallon jug, refill the 5-gallon jug, and then pour water from the 5-gallon jug into the 3-gallon jug until it's overflowing.

Doubling this average would give me 6mph. To reach 6mph on the way back, I'd have to run twice as fast as my 3mph walk, which is 6mph. However, since walking and running are different activities with different speeds, I'd have to run even faster than this. In fact, my running speed would have to outpace my walking speed by the difference between the two activities' speeds.
