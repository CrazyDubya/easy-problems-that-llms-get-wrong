The surprising truth is that you need far fewer people than you might think to have a good chance of a shared birthday.  Here's why:\n\n* **Focus on Differences:** Instead of calculating the probability of a match, it's easier to calculate the probability that *no one* shares a birthday.\n* **Twin Advantage:** With twins, you're guaranteed at least two people share a birthday right from the start.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n* **1 Pair (2 people):** 100% chance of a shared birthday (the twins).\n* **2 Pairs (4 people):**  While the probability is high, it's not guaranteed to be over 50%. There's a chance the second set of twins has a different birthday.\n\nAs we add more pairs, the probability of *no shared birthdays* (besides the twin pairs) decreases rapidly.

This is due to the surprisingly large number of possible pairings.* **Twins Don't Change the Odds:** While twins share a birthday, we're looking for *any* two people in the room with the same birthday.

Convert each prisoner's number to its binary equivalent (e.g., Prisoner 1 is 001, Prisoner 2 is 010, Prisoner 3 is 011, etc.).  Each digit in the binary number represents a specific wine bottle group.\n\n2. **Wine Assignment:** Each bottle of wine is also given a number from 1 to 1000.  A prisoner will sample a wine if their corresponding binary digit is a '1' for that bottle's number.  For example:\n    * Bottle 1 (0000000001 in binary): Only Prisoner 1 drinks from this bottle.\n    * Bottle 3 (0000000011 in binary): Prisoner 1 and Prisoner 2 drink from this bottle.\n    * Bottle 7 (0000000111 in binary): Prisoner 1, Prisoner 2, and Prisoner 3 drink from this bottle.\n\n3. **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died. Construct a binary number where '1' represents a dead prisoner and '0' represents a living prisoner. This binary number directly translates to the poisoned bottle number.\n\n**Example:** If Prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 011001, which converts to the decimal number 25, indicating bottle number 25 is poisoned.\n\n**Why this works:** This binary strategy allows you to test a large number of items (wine bottles) with a smaller number of tests (prisoners).
