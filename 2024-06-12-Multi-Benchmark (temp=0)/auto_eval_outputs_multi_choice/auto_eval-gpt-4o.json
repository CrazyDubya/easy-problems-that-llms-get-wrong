This is because the host's action of revealing a rotten vegetable behind one of the other doors effectively transfers the 2\/3 probability to the remaining unopened door.\n\nGiven this analysis, switching doors gives you a higher probability of winning the gold bar.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to switch to Door No. 2.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"A\"\n}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"2":{"level_0":2,"index":3,"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"To solve this problem efficiently, we need to leverage the information provided by the 10 prisoners in a way that maximizes the number of bottles we can test within the 24-hour window. The key insight here is to use a binary representation to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0000000000 (for bottle 1) to 1111101000 (for bottle 1000). This is because 1000 bottles can be represented by 10 bits (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000).\n\n2. **Assigning Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners can be assigned to a specific bit position in the binary representation of the bottle numbers. For example, Prisoner 1 could be responsible for the least significant bit, Prisoner 2 for the next bit, and so on up to Prisoner 10 for the most significant bit.\n\n3. **Testing Strategy**: Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1. For instance, if a bottle's binary representation is 0101010101, then Prisoners 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 will drink from that bottle.\n\n4. **Interpreting Results**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, using the information from the 10 prisoners efficiently.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"17":{"level_0":17,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Typically, trees gain mass by absorbing water, nutrients, and carbon dioxide, and through the process of photosynthesis, they convert these into biomass. The soil provides some of the nutrients, but the majority of the tree's mass comes from carbon dioxide in the air and water.\n\nTherefore, the soil itself does not lose a significant amount of mass as the tree grows. The nutrients taken from the soil are minimal in terms of mass compared to the overall mass of the soil.\n\nGiven this understanding, the amount of soil left in the pot should remain approximately the same as it was initially, which is 10kg.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"28":{"level_0":28,"index":29,"category":"Relational","question":"A man steps over a 0.5m hurdle.

This leaves 5 chambers, all of which are now loaded with bullets.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, you will be firing the revolver with one of the remaining 5 chambers, all of which contain bullets.

The key insight here is to use a binary representation of the bottle numbers and assign each prisoner to test a specific combination of bottles.\n\nHere's the detailed reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is more than 1000). For example, bottle 1 is 0000000001, bottle 2 is 0000000010, and so on up to bottle 1000.\n\n2. **Assigning Tests**: Each prisoner will be responsible for testing bottles based on the binary representation of the bottle numbers. For instance, prisoner 1 will test all bottles where the least significant bit (rightmost bit) is 1, prisoner 2 will test all bottles where the second least significant bit is 1, and so on.\n\n3. **Interpreting Results**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 4 die, the binary number formed would be 0000001011, which corresponds to bottle number 11.\n\nGiven this strategy, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"47":{"level_0":47,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Therefore, we need \\( 2n \\geq 23 \\).\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\\[ n \\geq \\frac{23}{2} \\]\n\\[ n \\geq 11.5 \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:\n\\[ n = 12 \\]\n\nThus, we need at least 12 pairs of twins to have a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"54":{"level_0":54,"index":25,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

By putting the guest in an empty room.\n- This option assumes there is an empty room available, but it doesn't specify how to ensure that there is always an empty room in an infinite hotel. It doesn't utilize the concept of infinity effectively.\n\nB. You ask each current guest to move to the room number n*2.\n- This option would move each guest to a room with an even number, effectively freeing up all the odd-numbered rooms.

Importantly, the host's offer implies that Door No. 2 is not the door with the rotten vegetables (if it were, the host would not offer it).\n\n3. **Switching Strategy**: If you switch to Door No. 2, you are effectively betting that the gold bar is behind one of the two doors you did not initially pick (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3).

This means there is only one empty chamber. When your opponent spins the chambers and fires at himself, he lands on the empty chamber, so there are now five chambers left, all of which are loaded with bullets.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, you will be firing the revolver with the next chamber in sequence. Since there are five bullets and only one empty chamber, the probability of the next chamber being loaded with a bullet is very high.\n\nHowever, if you spin the chambers again, you reset the probabilities. With a fresh spin, there are still six chambers, but only one of them is empty.

The key constraint is that the bulbs are LED and do not get warm when turned on. This eliminates any method that relies on feeling the warmth of the bulbs to determine which switch controls which bulb.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Turning each switch on one at a time and observing the bulbs.\n- This method would work if you could observe the bulbs directly after each switch is turned on. However, the problem implies that you cannot observe the bulbs directly from the same room.\n\nB. You must walk into another room to observe the bulbs.\n- This option suggests that you can only observe the bulbs from another room. This is a crucial piece of information because it means you cannot see the bulbs while you are operating the switches.\n\nC. Turning two switches on for a while, turn one off, then touching the bulbs to see which is warm and which one is on.\n- This method is invalid because the bulbs are LED and do not get warm when turned on.\n\nD. Turning all of the switches on at once and observing the bulbs.\n- This method would not help you determine which switch controls which bulb because all bulbs would be on simultaneously, and you would not be able to distinguish which switch controls which bulb.\n\nGiven the constraints and the need to observe the bulbs from another room, the best approach is to use a systematic method that allows you to correlate the switches with the bulbs. The most logical approach is:\n\n1. Turn on switch A and leave it on for a while.\n2. Turn on switch B and leave it on for a while.\n3. Turn off switch A.\n4. Walk into the other room to observe the bulbs.\n\n- The bulb that is on corresponds to switch B.\n- The bulb that is off but was recently on corresponds to switch A.\n- The bulb that is off and was never on corresponds to switch C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"76":{"level_0":76,"index":17,"category":"Puzzle","question":"The Poisoned Wine - A king has 1000 sweet bottles of wine, and one contains a very bitter poison.

Given that there are 1000 bottles and 10 prisoners, we can use a binary representation strategy to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nEach bottle can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is more than 1000). We can assign each prisoner to a specific bit position in these binary numbers. For example, prisoner 1 can be responsible for the least significant bit, prisoner 2 for the next bit, and so on up to prisoner 10 for the most significant bit.\n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number from 0000000001 to 1111101000 (1 to 1000 in binary).\n2. Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1.\n3. After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number that directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if the poisoned bottle is number 13 (which is 0000001101 in binary), prisoners 1, 3, and 4 will die (since the binary representation of 13 has 1s in the 1st, 3rd, and 4th positions).\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with a single round of testing, leveraging the binary representation of numbers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"77":{"level_0":77,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"To solve this problem efficiently, we need to minimize the number of tests required to identify the poisoned bottle using the 10 prisoners available. The key insight here is to use a binary representation to leverage the 10 prisoners effectively.\n\nEach of the 1000 bottles can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is more than 1000). We can assign each bottle a binary number from 0000000000 to 1111100111 (which corresponds to 0 to 999 in decimal).\n\nHere's how the strategy works:\n1. Assign each bottle a unique 10-bit binary number.\n2. Each prisoner will be responsible for one bit position in the binary number.\n3. If a bottle has a '1' in a specific bit position, the corresponding prisoner will drink from that bottle.\n4. After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number that directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if the poisoned bottle is number 13 (which is 0000001101 in binary), prisoners 1, 3, and 4 (counting from the right, starting at 0) will drink from it. If these prisoners die, the binary number 0000001101 can be decoded to identify bottle 13 as the poisoned one.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, using the binary representation of the bottle numbers and the 10 prisoners.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"107":{"level_0":107,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, where the number of possible pairs grows rapidly with the number of people.\n\nIn this problem, we are dealing with pairs of twins. Each pair of twins shares the same birthday, so we can think of each pair as a single entity when considering the probability of shared birthdays.\n\nIf we have \\( n \\) pairs of twins, we effectively have \\( 2n \\) individuals. To find the number of pairs of twins needed to have at least a 50% chance that two people (from different pairs) share the same birthday, we need to find \\( n \\) such that \\( 2n \\) individuals have a greater than 50% chance of sharing a birthday.\n\nFrom the birthday paradox, we know that 23 individuals are needed for a 50% chance. Therefore, we need \\( 2n \\geq 23 \\).\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\\[ 2n \\geq 23 \\]\n\\[ n \\geq 11.5 \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:\n\\[ n = 12 \\]\n\nThus, we need 12 pairs of twins to have at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"114":{"level_0":114,"index":25,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0000000000 (for bottle 1) to 1111101000 (for bottle 1000). This is because 1000 bottles can be represented by 10 bits (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000).\n\n2. **Assigning Tests**: Each prisoner will be assigned to a specific bit position in the binary representation. For example, prisoner 1 will be responsible for the first bit, prisoner 2 for the second bit, and so on up to prisoner 10.\n\n3. **Testing Process**: Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1. For instance, prisoner 1 will drink from all bottles where the first bit is 1 (i.e., bottles 1, 3, 5, 7, etc.), prisoner 2 will drink from all bottles where the second bit is 1 (i.e., bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, etc.), and so on.\n\n4. **Interpreting Results**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing and within the 24-hour timeframe.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"137":{"level_0":137,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Given that the poison takes exactly 24 hours to take effect, we can use a binary representation strategy to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is more than 1000). Each bit in the binary number can correspond to whether a specific prisoner drinks from that bottle or not.\n\n2. **Assigning Bottles to Prisoners**: Assign each bottle a number from 0 to 999. Convert each number to its 10-bit binary equivalent. Each bit in the binary number will determine whether a specific prisoner drinks from that bottle. For example, if the binary representation of a bottle number is `1010101010`, then prisoners 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 will drink from that bottle.\n\n3. **Observation**: After 24 hours, observe which prisoners are dead. The combination of dead prisoners will form a binary number, which corresponds to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, using the binary representation of the bottle numbers and the 10 prisoners.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"167":{"level_0":167,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

When your opponent spins the chambers and fires, he lands on the one empty chamber, leaving 5 chambers with 5 bullets.\n\nIf you do not spin again, you know that the current chamber is empty, and there are 5 remaining chambers with 5 bullets. The probability of firing a bullet in this case is 5\/5, which is 1 (or 100%).\n\nIf you spin the chambers again, you reset the probabilities to the initial state, where there are 6 chambers and 5 bullets. The probability of firing a bullet in this case is 5\/6.\n\nComparing the two scenarios:\n- Not spinning: Probability of firing a bullet is 1 (100%).\n- Spinning: Probability of firing a bullet is 5\/6 (approximately 83.33%).\n\nSince 5\/6 is less than 1, it is safer to spin the chambers again.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to spin the chambers again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"213":{"level_0":213,"index":4,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

This is the most efficient method because it allows us to test all 1000 bottles with just 10 prisoners. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Number each bottle from 1 to 1000.\n2. Convert each bottle number to a 10-bit binary number (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000).\n3. Assign each bit position to a prisoner. For example, the first prisoner is responsible for the least significant bit, the second prisoner for the next bit, and so on up to the 10th prisoner who is responsible for the most significant bit.\n4. Have each prisoner drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is 1. For example, if a bottle's binary number is 101 (which is 5 in decimal), the prisoners responsible for the 1st and 3rd bits will drink from that bottle.\n5. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners are affected by the poison. The combination of affected prisoners will form a binary number that corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the exact poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, making it the fastest and most efficient approach.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are less efficient:\n- B involves dividing the bottles among prisoners, but it doesn't specify a systematic way to identify the poisoned bottle efficiently.\n- C suggests all prisoners sample each bottle, which is impractical and doesn't leverage the limited number of prisoners effectively.\n- D involves tasting for bitterness, which is not reliable since the poison's effect is delayed by 24 hours.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"227":{"level_0":227,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Given that we have 10 prisoners and 1000 bottles, we can use a binary representation strategy to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0000000000 (0 in decimal) to 1111101000 (999 in decimal). This gives us a 10-bit binary number for each bottle.\n\n2. **Assigning Tests**: Each prisoner will represent a bit in the binary number. For example, prisoner 1 will represent the least significant bit (2^0), prisoner 2 will represent the next bit (2^1), and so on up to prisoner 10 who will represent the most significant bit (2^9).\n\n3. **Testing Strategy**: Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1. For instance, prisoner 1 will drink from all bottles where the least significant bit is 1 (i.e., bottles 1, 3, 5, 7, etc.), prisoner 2 will drink from bottles where the second bit is 1 (i.e., bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, etc.), and so on.\n\n4. **Identifying the Poisoned Bottle**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with a maximum of 10 tests, leveraging the binary representation of numbers.\n\nGiven the options, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"257":{"level_0":257,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The key here is to use a method that allows us to identify the poisoned bottle with the least number of tests.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n- This option is not feasible because the poison takes effect after 24 hours, and the prisoners won't be able to immediately note which one tastes bitter.\n\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\n- This option is impractical because it would result in the death of all prisoners if they all sample each bottle.\n\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\n- This option is also not efficient because it doesn't leverage the full potential of the 10 prisoners to minimize the number of tests.\n\nD. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours.\n- This option is the most efficient. By using a binary representation, each bottle can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000). Each prisoner will be assigned to drink from bottles based on the binary representation of the bottle numbers. For example, if a bottle's binary representation has a '1' in the first position, the first prisoner will drink from it, and so on. After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will correspond to the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best and fastest way to identify the poisoned bottle is option D.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"287":{"level_0":287,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Instead, we can use a binary representation strategy.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0 to 999 (which is 1000 in decimal). This requires 10 bits because \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is enough to cover all 1000 bottles.\n\n2. **Assigning Bottles to Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners will be assigned a position in the binary number (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit). For each bottle, if a bit in its binary representation is 1, the corresponding prisoner will drink from that bottle.\n\n3. **Identifying the Poisoned Bottle**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a unique binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if bottle number 5 (which is 0000000101 in binary) is poisoned, prisoners 1 and 3 (counting from the least significant bit) will die. The binary number formed by the dead prisoners will be 0000000101, which is 5 in decimal, identifying the poisoned bottle.\n\nGiven this strategy, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"317":{"level_0":317,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Choice**: You initially pick Door No. 1. The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, offers you the chance to switch to Door No. 2. Importantly, the host's offer implies that Door No. 2 is not the door with the rotten vegetables (if it were, the host would not offer it).\n\n3. **Switching vs. Staying**:\n   - If you **stay** with Door No. 1, your probability of winning the gold bar remains 1\/3.\n   - If you **switch** to Door No. 2, your probability of winning the gold bar increases to 2\/3. This is because the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge of what is behind the doors, and the initial probability of the gold bar being behind one of the other two doors was 2\/3.\n\nTherefore, switching doors gives you a higher probability of winning the gold bar.\n\nGiven the options:\n- A. They have equal probability of winning\n- B. Door No. 2\n- C. Door No. 1\n- D. Door No. 3\n\nThe correct answer is B.

This means there is only one empty chamber. When your opponent spins the chambers and fires, he lands on the empty chamber, leaving five chambers, all of which are loaded with bullets.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, you know that the next chamber in sequence is one of the five loaded chambers.

Here\u2019s the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each of the 1000 bottles can be represented by a unique binary number from 0000000000 (for bottle 0) to 1111101000 (for bottle 999). This requires 10 bits because \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is enough to cover all 1000 bottles.\n\n2. **Assigning Tests**: Each prisoner can be assigned to a specific bit position in the binary representation of the bottle numbers. For example, prisoner 1 could be responsible for the least significant bit, prisoner 2 for the next bit, and so on up to prisoner 10 for the most significant bit.\n\n3. **Testing Strategy**: Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1. For instance, if a bottle's binary representation is 0101010101, then prisoners 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 will drink from that bottle.\n\n4. **Interpreting Results**: After 24 hours, the pattern of which prisoners die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, using the binary results from the 10 prisoners.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"347":{"level_0":347,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

However, the problem does not specify that the soil itself loses weight as a result of the tree's growth. In most practical scenarios, the soil's weight remains relatively constant because the nutrients and water absorbed by the tree are a very small fraction of the total soil mass.\n\nTherefore, the weight of the soil remains the same at 10kg.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"358":{"level_0":358,"index":29,"category":"Relational","question":"A man steps over a 0.5m hurdle.

Given that we have 10 prisoners and 1000 bottles, we can leverage the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0000000000 (0 in decimal) to 1111101000 (999 in decimal). This gives us a 10-bit binary number for each bottle.\n\n2. **Assigning Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners can be assigned to a specific bit position in the binary representation of the bottle numbers. For example, Prisoner 1 can be assigned to the least significant bit (2^0), Prisoner 2 to the next bit (2^1), and so on up to Prisoner 10 who is assigned to the most significant bit (2^9).\n\n3. **Testing Strategy**: Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1. For instance, if a bottle's binary representation is 1010101010, then Prisoners 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 will drink from that bottle.\n\n4. **Identifying the Poisoned Bottle**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, using the binary representation of the bottle numbers and the 10 prisoners.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"377":{"level_0":377,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Thus, we need 23 pairs of twins to have at least a 50% chance that two people in the room have the same birthday.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"384":{"level_0":384,"index":25,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

You ask each current guest to move to the room number n*2.\n   - This would move each guest to an even-numbered room, freeing up all the odd-numbered rooms. This is a valid way to accommodate more guests, but it is not the simplest solution for just one additional guest.\n\nB.

Given that there are 1000 bottles and only 10 prisoners, a direct approach where each prisoner tests a subset of bottles would not be efficient enough. Instead, we can use a binary representation strategy to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0 to 999 (which is 1000 in decimal). This requires 10 bits (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) which is more than 1000).\n\n2. **Assigning Bottles to Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners can be assigned a position in the binary number (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit). For each bottle, if a bit in its binary representation is 1, the corresponding prisoner will drink from that bottle.\n\n3. **Identifying the Poisoned Bottle**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a unique binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if bottle number 5 (which is 0000000101 in binary) is poisoned, prisoners 1 and 3 (counting from the least significant bit) will die. This will form the binary number 0000000101, which is 5 in decimal, identifying the poisoned bottle.\n\nGiven this strategy, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"407":{"level_0":407,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The probability of firing a bullet after spinning is 5\/6.\n\nComparing the two probabilities:\n- Not spinning: 100% chance of firing a bullet.\n- Spinning: 5\/6 (approximately 83.33%) chance of firing a bullet.\n\nSince 83.33% is less than 100%, it is safer to spin the chambers again.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to spin the chambers again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"423":{"level_0":423,"index":4,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

This means there is only 1 empty chamber. When your opponent spins the chambers and fires, he lands on the empty chamber, leaving 5 chambers with bullets and 1 empty chamber.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, the revolver's current state is that there is 1 empty chamber and 5 chambers with bullets. Since the opponent just fired and landed on the empty chamber, the next chamber in sequence is highly likely to contain a bullet. Therefore, the probability of firing a bullet if you do not spin again is very high (5 out of 5 remaining chambers).\n\nIf you spin the chambers again, you reset the probabilities.

After the fourth left turn and walking 1 km, he will be back at his starting point.\n\nNow, let's analyze the elevation changes:\n- The elevation changes are given as 300m, 500m, and 900m at each respective turn.\n- However, the final elevation after the fourth turn is not explicitly given.\n\nGiven that he returns to his starting point after completing the square, his horizontal distance from the starting point is 0m. The elevation at the starting point is 0m, and there is no indication that the elevation changes again after the fourth turn.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"463":{"level_0":463,"index":14,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A group of four people needs to cross a bridge at night.

The key insight here is to use a binary representation strategy.\n\nEach bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0 to 999 (which is 1000 in decimal). Since we have 10 prisoners, we can use each prisoner to represent a bit in the binary number (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000). \n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Label each bottle with a unique number from 0 to 999.\n2. Convert each number to its 10-bit binary equivalent.\n3. Assign each bit position to a prisoner. For example, the first bit to prisoner 1, the second bit to prisoner 2, and so on up to the tenth bit.\n4. Have each prisoner drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is 1. For example, if a bottle's binary representation is 1010101010, prisoners 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 will drink from that bottle.\n5. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners die. The combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number that corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, using the binary representation of the bottle numbers and the 10 prisoners.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"467":{"level_0":467,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Given that we have 10 prisoners and 1000 bottles, we can use a binary representation strategy to achieve this.\n\nEach bottle can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is more than enough to cover 1000 bottles). We can assign each prisoner to a specific bit position in these binary numbers. \n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Label each bottle with a number from 0 to 999.\n2. Convert each bottle number to its 10-bit binary equivalent.\n3. Assign each prisoner to a specific bit position (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit).\n4. Have each prisoner drink from all the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1.\n\nFor example, if bottle number 5 (which is 0000000101 in binary) is poisoned, prisoners assigned to the 1st and 3rd bits will drink from it. If both prisoners die, we can deduce that the poisoned bottle is number 5.\n\nBy observing which prisoners die after 24 hours, we can reconstruct the binary number of the poisoned bottle. This method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with a maximum of 10 prisoners in a single round of testing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"497":{"level_0":497,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0000000000 (for bottle 1) to 1111101000 (for bottle 1000). This is because 1000 bottles can be represented by 10 bits (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000).\n\n2. **Assigning Tests**: Each prisoner will be assigned a position in the binary number. For example, prisoner 1 will be responsible for the first bit, prisoner 2 for the second bit, and so on up to prisoner 10.\n\n3. **Testing Strategy**: Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit in the binary representation is 1. For example, prisoner 1 will drink from all bottles where the first bit is 1, prisoner 2 will drink from all bottles where the second bit is 1, and so on.\n\n4. **Interpreting Results**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the exact poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, leveraging the binary system to maximize the information gained from each prisoner.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"527":{"level_0":527,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Importantly, the host's offer implies that Door No. 2 is not the door with the rotten vegetables (if it were, the host would not offer it).\n\n3. **Switching Strategy**: If you switch to Door No. 2, you are effectively betting that your initial choice (Door No. 1) was wrong.

This means there is one empty chamber. When your opponent spins the chambers and fires, he lands on the empty chamber, leaving five chambers, all of which are still loaded with bullets.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, the revolver is in the same state as it was after your opponent fired: one empty chamber and five loaded chambers. Since the revolver did not fire, the empty chamber is now known to be in one specific position, and the next chamber in sequence is one of the five loaded ones. Therefore, the probability of firing a bullet if you do not spin again is 5\/5 or 100%.\n\nIf you spin the chambers again, you reset the probabilities. The revolver will have six chambers with one empty and five loaded, making the probability of landing on the empty chamber 1\/6 or approximately 16.67%.\n\nGiven these probabilities, it is clear that spinning the chambers again reduces your chances of firing a bullet from 100% to approximately 16.67%.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to spin the chambers again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"543":{"level_0":543,"index":4,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

The key here is to use a strategy that maximizes the information we can get from the limited number of prisoners.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\nA. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\n- This is not practical because it would result in all prisoners dying if they all sample the poisoned bottle.\n\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\n- This approach is inefficient because it doesn't use the prisoners optimally. With 1000 bottles and only 10 prisoners, it would be impossible to test all bottles within 24 hours.\n\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n- This is not feasible because the poison's effect is not immediate; it takes 24 hours to manifest, so tasting for bitterness won't work.\n\nD. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours.\n- This is the most efficient method. By using a binary representation, each prisoner can represent a bit in a 10-bit binary number (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than enough to cover 1000 bottles). Each bottle can be assigned a unique binary number, and each prisoner drinks from bottles corresponding to the binary digits where they have a '1'. After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will reveal the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"557":{"level_0":557,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, offers you the chance to switch to Door No. 2. This implies that the host is revealing information indirectly. If the gold bar were behind Door No. 2, the host would not offer you to switch to Door No. 2 if it were a losing door.\n\n3. **Switching Strategy**: If you switch, you are effectively choosing between the two remaining doors (Door No. 2 and Door No. 3). Since the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge of the doors' contents, the probability of winning by switching is higher.\n\n4. **Probability Analysis**:\n   - If you stick with Door No. 1, the probability of winning remains 1\/3.\n   - If you switch to Door No. 2, the probability of winning becomes 2\/3 because the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge that Door No. 1 is more likely to be a losing door.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy is to switch to Door No. 2, as it gives you a higher probability of winning the gold bar.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"ANSWER\": \"A\"\n}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"572":{"level_0":572,"index":3,"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Since your opponent has already fired once and no bullet came out, there is only one empty chamber left. The revolver did not fire, so the chamber that was just fired is now empty. This means that the next chamber in sequence has a bullet. Therefore, if you do not spin again, the probability of firing a bullet is 5 out of 5, or 100%.\n\n### Scenario 2: Spinning Again\nIf you spin the chambers again, you are essentially resetting the probabilities. With 5 bullets in 6 chambers, the probability of firing a bullet is 5 out of 6, or approximately 83.33%.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy comparing the probabilities:\n- Not spinning again: 100% chance of firing a bullet.\n- Spinning again: 83.33% chance of firing a bullet.\n\nClearly, spinning the chambers again gives you a lower probability of firing a bullet.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to spin the chambers again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"573":{"level_0":573,"index":4,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Assuming we are looking from Bella's perspective, Charlie would be on Bella's right side.\n\nLet's place Bella and Alex first:\n- Bella is facing Alex.\n\nNow, place Charlie:\n- If Bella is facing Alex, and Charlie is to the right of Bella, then Charlie must be to Bella's right side.\n\nThis leaves one position for Dana.\n\nHere is the seating arrangement:\n- Bella is facing Alex.\n- Charlie is to the right of Bella.\n- Dana must be the remaining person.\n\nSo, the arrangement is:\n- Bella is facing Alex.\n- Charlie is to the right of Bella.\n- Dana is to the left of Bella.\n\nSince Alex is facing Bella, and Charlie is to the right of Bella, Dana must be to the left of Alex.\n\nTherefore, the person sitting to the left of Alex is Dana.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"582":{"level_0":582,"index":13,"category":"Spatial","question":"A man leaves home at 0m elevation, makes a left turn and walks straight for a km and reaches 300m elevation, makes another left turn and walks straight for a km and reaches 500m elevation, makes another left turn and walks straight for a km and reaches 900m elevation, and turns left again and walks straight for a km.

Here\u2019s the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0000000000 (for bottle 1) to 1111101000 (for bottle 1000). This is because 1000 in binary is 1111101000, which fits within 10 bits (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000).\n\n2. **Assigning Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners can be assigned to a specific bit position in the binary representation of the bottle numbers. For example, prisoner 1 could be responsible for the least significant bit, prisoner 2 for the next bit, and so on up to prisoner 10 for the most significant bit.\n\n3. **Testing Strategy**: Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit in the binary representation is 1. For instance, if a bottle's binary representation is 0000000001, only prisoner 1 will drink from it. If a bottle's binary representation is 0000000011, prisoners 1 and 2 will drink from it.\n\n4. **Interpreting Results**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the exact poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, using the binary results from the 10 prisoners.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"587":{"level_0":587,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This way, if a guest is currently in room n, they move to room n+1. This shift leaves room 1 empty for the new guest.\n\nLet's break it down:\n- If the hotel is partially full, there are some rooms that are already occupied and some that are empty.\n- By moving each current guest from room n to room n+1, you ensure that no guest is left without a room.\n- Room 1, which was previously occupied, becomes empty and available for the new guest.\n\nThis method works because the hotel has an infinite number of rooms, so there will always be a next room available for each guest to move into.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"595":{"level_0":595,"index":26,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A runaway trolley is heading down the tracks away from five people upwards of the track.

The mass of the tree increases primarily due to the carbon dioxide absorbed from the air during photosynthesis, which is converted into organic matter. The soil provides nutrients and water, but the mass of the soil itself does not significantly decrease as the tree grows. The nutrients taken up by the tree are relatively small in mass compared to the total mass of the soil.\n\nTherefore, the mass of the soil remains largely unchanged as the tree grows.
