This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and allows the king to find the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink a small amount of wine from each bottle in their group.\n3. Wait 24 hours to see which prisoners, if any, are affected by the poison.\n4. If none of the prisoners are affected, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was not tested. Have one of the prisoners drink from each bottle in that group to find the poisoned bottle.\n5. If one or more prisoners are affected, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that they drank from. Divide that group into 10 smaller groups of 10 bottles each and repeat the process with the remaining prisoners.\n6. Continue this process until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to find the poisoned bottle in as few as 7 tests, assuming that the poisoned bottle is in the first group tested. In the worst-case scenario, it would take 10 tests to find the poisoned bottle.\n\nOption B is not a viable solution because it would require all 10 prisoners to drink from all 1000 bottles, which would take too long and could result in multiple prisoners being poisoned.\n\nOption C is not a viable solution because it relies on the prisoners being able to taste the poison, which may not be possible if the poison is tasteless or if the wine is very sweet.\n\nOption D is not a viable solution because it would require the prisoners to drink from potentially poisoned bottles, which could result in multiple prisoners being poisoned.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"47":{"level_0":47,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Since twins share the same birthday, we only need to consider the number of pairs of twins, not the total number of people.\n\nLet's denote the number of pairs of twins as T.

If the guardian you asked points to the death door, they are the truthful guardian, and the lying guardian would have pointed to the freedom door.\n\nTherefore, you should choose the opposite door of the one indicated by the guardian you asked.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"75":{"level_0":75,"index":16,"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and allows the king to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink a small amount of wine from each bottle in their group.\n3. Wait 24 hours to see which prisoner(s) were affected by the poison.\n4. If only one prisoner was affected, then the poisoned bottle is in their group. If more than one prisoner was affected, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that both affected prisoners had in common.\n5.

By turning each switch on one at a time and observing the bulbs, we can determine which switch corresponds to which bulb.

Since the speed is given in miles per hour (mph) and no distance is provided, we can assume that the distance is irrelevant to the problem.\n\nNext, let's find the time it takes to walk to your friend's house at 3mph. Since we don't have the distance, we can't calculate the exact time, but we can express the time as a function of distance:\n\nTime = Distance \/ Speed\nTime_walk = Distance \/ 3mph\n\nNow, let's find the time it would take to run back at a certain speed, which we'll call \"Speed_run\". Again, we can express the time as a function of distance:\n\nTime_run = Distance \/ Speed_run\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is the total distance divided by the total time. Since the distance to and from your friend's house is the same, the total distance is 2 * Distance. The total time is the sum of the time walking and the time running:\n\nTotal_time = Time_walk + Time_run\nTotal_time = (Distance \/ 3mph) + (Distance \/ Speed_run)\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is:\n\nAverage_speed = Total_distance \/ Total_time\nAverage_speed = (2 * Distance) \/ [(Distance \/ 3mph) + (Distance \/ Speed_run)]\n\nWe want to find the speed at which you would have to run back to double your average speed for the entire trip. Let's set the average speed equal to twice your walking speed:\n\nAverage_speed = 2 * 3mph\nAverage_speed = 6mph\n\nNow we can solve for Speed_run:\n\n6mph = (2 * Distance) \/ [(Distance \/ 3mph) + (Distance \/ Speed_run)]\n\nTo solve for Speed_run, we can cross-multiply and simplify:\n\n6mph * [(Distance \/ 3mph) + (Distance \/ Speed_run)] = 2 * Distance\n\nDivide both sides by Distance:\n\n6mph * [(1 \/ 3mph) + (1 \/ Speed_run)] = 2\n\nNow, distribute the 6mph:\n\n(6mph \/ 3mph) + (6mph \/ Speed_run) = 2\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 + (6mph \/ Speed_run) = 2\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n(6mph \/ Speed_run) = 0\n\nThis equation has no solution, as dividing by Speed_run would result in division by zero, which is undefined. However, we can see that the only way for the average speed to be double the walking speed is if the running speed is infinitely fast, as this would minimize the time spent running and maximize the average speed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n\nExplanation:\nThe best way to determine which switch turns on which light bulb is to turn each switch on one at a time and observe the bulbs. This is because the LED bulbs do not get warm when turned on, so touching them to see which one is warm will not work. Also, turning all the switches on at once will not allow you to determine which switch corresponds to which bulb. Walking into another room to observe the bulbs is not necessary as the bulbs are already in the same room. Therefore, turning each switch on one at a time and observing the bulbs is the best way to determine which switch turns on which light bulb.","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"136":{"level_0":136,"index":17,"category":"Puzzle","question":"The Poisoned Wine - A king has 1000 sweet bottles of wine, and one contains a very bitter poison.

Initially, the probability of winning the gold bar is 1\/3 for each door. However, after the host opens one door (say door No. 3) revealing rotten vegetables, the probabilities change. The probability that the gold bar is behind door No. 1 remains 1\/3, but the probability that the gold bar is behind door No. 2 increases to 2\/3. This is because the host's action of opening door No. 3 provides additional information. Therefore, switching to door No. 2 gives the biggest advantage.

However, the question is asking about pairs of twins, which means we are dealing with 2 people having the same birthday by default.\n\nSince we are looking for at least a 50% chance that two people (not including twins) have the same birthday, we can still use the birthday paradox. We need to find the number of non-twin individuals required to reach a 50% chance of a shared birthday.\n\nThe formula to calculate the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in a group of n people is:\n\nP(n) = 1 - (365! \/ (365^n * (365-n)!))\n\nWe want to find the smallest n such that P(n) >= 0.5.\n\nUsing a calculator or programming language, we can find that n = 23 satisfies this condition. However, since we are dealing with pairs of twins, we need to subtract the number of twins from this total.\n\nSince each pair of twins counts as 2 people, we can have 23 - 2 = 21 pairs of twins in the room, and still have a 50% chance that two non-twin individuals share a birthday.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of pairs of twins, not the number of non-twin individuals.

Since the speed is given in miles per hour (mph) and no distance is provided, we can assume that the distance is irrelevant to the problem.\n\nNext, let's find the time it takes to walk to your friend's house at 3mph. Since we don't have the distance, we can't calculate the exact time, but we can express the time as a function of distance:\n\nTime = Distance \/ Speed\nTime_walk = Distance \/ 3mph\n\nNow, let's find the time it would take to run back at a certain speed, which we'll call \"Speed_run\". Again, we can express the time as a function of distance:\n\nTime_run = Distance \/ Speed_run\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is the total distance divided by the total time. Since the distance to and from your friend's house is the same, the total distance is 2 * Distance. The total time is the sum of the time it takes to walk and the time it takes to run:\n\nTotal_time = Time_walk + Time_run\nTotal_time = (Distance \/ 3mph) + (Distance \/ Speed_run)\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is:\n\nAverage_speed = Total_distance \/ Total_time\nAverage_speed = (2 * Distance) \/ [(Distance \/ 3mph) + (Distance \/ Speed_run)]\n\nWe want to find the speed at which you would have to run back to double your average speed for the entire trip. Let's call this speed \"Speed_double\". The average speed for the entire trip would then be twice your walking speed:\n\nAverage_speed = 2 * 3mph = 6mph\n\nNow we can set up the equation:\n\n6mph = (2 * Distance) \/ [(Distance \/ 3mph) + (Distance \/ Speed_double)]\n\nSince the distance is the same in both the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out:\n\n6mph = 2 \/ [(1 \/ 3mph) + (1 \/ Speed_double)]\n\nNow we can solve for Speed_double:\n\n6mph = 2 \/ [(1 \/ 3mph) + (1 \/ Speed_double)]\n6mph * [(1 \/ 3mph) + (1 \/ Speed_double)] = 2\n2 + (2 \/ Speed_double) = 2\n(2 \/ Speed_double) = 0\n\nThis equation has no solution, which means that it's not possible to double your average speed for the entire trip by running back at any finite speed.

This is because the bulbs are LED and do not get warm when turned on, so touching them to see which one is warm (option D) would not work. Also, turning all the switches on at once (option C) would not allow you to determine which switch corresponds to which bulb.

Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"A\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from the bottles in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoner(s) were affected by the poison.\n4. If only one prisoner was affected, then the poisoned bottle is in their group. If more than one prisoner was affected, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was common to all affected prisoners.\n5. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles in the identified group(s) until the poisoned bottle is found.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to narrow down the search space quickly and efficiently, using the minimum number of prisoners necessary. Option B is not ideal because it risks the lives of all prisoners, and option C is not feasible because it would require each prisoner to drink from all 1000 bottles, which is not possible in 24 hours. Option D is not reliable because the poison may not have a noticeable taste.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"227":{"level_0":227,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Since the distance to your friend's house is the same in both directions, we can use the harmonic mean formula for average speed:\n\nAverage speed = 2 * (speed1 * speed2) \/ (speed1 + speed2)\n\nIn this case, speed1 is 3mph (walking to your friend's house), and speed2 is x mph (running back). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nAverage speed = 2 * (3 * x) \/ (3 + x)\n\nWe want the average speed for the entire trip to be double the walking speed, which is 6mph. So we can set up the equation:\n\n6 = 2 * (3 * x) \/ (3 + x)\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\n6 * (3 + x) = 2 * (3 * x)\n18 + 6x = 6x\n18 = 6x - 6x\n18 = 0\n\nThis equation has no solution, which means that it's not possible to double the average speed for the entire trip by running back at any finite speed.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"To solve this problem, we need to find the speed at which you would have to run back to double your average speed for the entire trip.\n\nFirst, let's find the total distance to your friend's house. Since the speed is given in miles per hour (mph) and no distance is provided, we can assume that the distance is not relevant to the problem.\n\nNext, let's find the time it takes to walk to your friend's house at 3mph. Since we don't have the distance, we can't calculate the exact time, but we can express the time in terms of distance:\n\nTime = Distance \/ Speed\nTime_walk = Distance \/ 3mph\n\nNow, let's find the time it would take to run back at a certain speed, which we'll call Speed_run. Again, we can express the time in terms of distance:\n\nTime_run = Distance \/ Speed_run\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is the total distance divided by the total time. Since the distance to and from your friend's house is the same, the total distance is 2 * Distance. The total time is the sum of the time it takes to walk and the time it takes to run:\n\nTotal_time = Time_walk + Time_run\nTotal_time = (Distance \/ 3mph) + (Distance \/ Speed_run)\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is:\n\nAverage_speed = Total_distance \/ Total_time\nAverage_speed = (2 * Distance) \/ [(Distance \/ 3mph) + (Distance \/ Speed_run)]\n\nWe want to find the speed at which you would have to run back to double your average speed for the entire trip. Let's call this speed Speed_double. The average speed for the entire trip would then be 6mph (twice the walking speed):\n\n6mph = (2 * Distance) \/ [(Distance \/ 3mph) + (Distance \/ Speed_double)]\n\nNow, we can solve for Speed_double:\n\n6mph = (2 * Distance) \/ [(Distance \/ 3mph) + (Distance \/ Speed_double)]\n6mph = 2 \/ [(1 \/ 3mph) + (1 \/ Speed_double)]\n6mph = 2 \/ [(Speed_double + 3mph) \/ (3mph * Speed_double)]\n6mph = 2 * (3mph * Speed_double) \/ (Speed_double + 3mph)\n6mph * (Speed_double + 3mph) = 2 * (3mph * Speed_double)\n6mph * Speed_double + 18mph = 6mph * Speed_double\n18mph = 6mph * Speed_double\nSpeed_double = 18mph \/ 6mph\nSpeed_double = 3mph\n\nHowever, this result doesn't make sense because running back at 3mph would not double the average speed for the entire trip. It seems that there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's try again:\n\n6mph = 2 \/ [(1 \/ 3mph) + (1 \/ Speed_double)]\n6mph = 2 \/ [(Speed_double + 3mph) \/ (3mph * Speed_double)]\n6mph = 2 * (3mph * Speed_double) \/ (Speed_double + 3mph)\n6mph * (Speed_double + 3mph) = 2 * (3mph * Speed_double)\n6mph * Speed_double + 18mph = 6mph * Speed_double\n18mph = 6mph * Speed_double\nSpeed_double = 18mph \/ 6mph\nSpeed_double = 3mph\n\nAgain, this result doesn't make sense. Let's try a different approach:\n\nWe know that the average speed for the entire trip is the total distance divided by the total time. If we want to double the average speed, we need to halve the total time. Since the walking time is fixed, we need to find the running time that would make the total time half of what it would be if we walked both ways.\n\nLet's call the walking time Time_walk and the running time Time_run. The total time for walking both ways would be 2 * Time_walk. We want the total time for walking one way and running the other way to be half of that:\n\nTotal_time = Time_walk + Time_run\nTotal_time = 2 * Time_walk \/ 2\nTotal_time = Time_walk\n\nThis means that the running time must be zero for the total time to be half of what it would be if we walked both ways. However, this is not possible since we can't run instantaneously. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Infinitely fast\n\nThe explanation is that in order to double the average speed for the entire trip, we would need to halve the total time. Since the walking time is fixed, the only way to halve the total time is to run back instantaneously, which is not possible. Therefore, the correct answer is that we would have to run back infinitely fast to double the average speed for the entire trip.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"330":{"level_0":330,"index":1,"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have six horses and want to race them to see which is fastest.

The birthday problem asks for the probability that in a group of randomly chosen people, any two people have the same birthday. However, this question asks for the number of pairs of twins needed for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people (not necessarily twins) have the same birthday.\n\nSince twins always share the same birthday, we can simplify the problem by considering each pair of twins as a single entity with a unique birthday. Therefore, we are looking for the number of unique birthdays (pairs of twins) needed to have a 50% chance that at least two entities share the same birthday.\n\nThe classic birthday problem tells us that with 23 people, there is approximately a 50% chance that at least two people share the same birthday. However, since we are dealing with pairs of twins, we need to consider the number of unique birthdays, not the total number of people.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n\nExplanation:\nWe need 23 pairs of twins (46 people) to have a 50% chance that at least two people (not necessarily twins) have the same birthday. Each pair of twins is considered as a single entity with a unique birthday, so we are looking for the number of unique birthdays needed to reach a 50% chance of a shared birthday.

To have at least a 50% chance that two people (in this case, two pairs of twins) have the same birthday, we only need two pairs of twins. This is because the first pair of twins will have a different birthday than the second pair of twins with a probability of 364\/365 (assuming 365 days in a year and ignoring leap years), and the probability that the second pair of twins has a different birthday than the first pair is also 364\/365.

This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them taste a small amount of wine from each bottle in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see if any prisoners die.\n4. If a prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in their group.

Continue this process until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle with the minimum number of tests and in the shortest amount of time possible.\n\nOption A is not feasible because the poison takes 24 hours to take effect, so the prisoners would not be able to identify the poisoned bottle by taste alone.\n\nOption C is unethical and would result in the death of a prisoner.\n\nOption D is also unethical and would result in the death of all the prisoners.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"To solve this problem, we first need to find the total distance to the friend's house. Since the walking speed is given as 3mph and we don't have the time taken to walk to the friend's house, we can't determine the exact distance. However, we can use a variable, let's say 'd', to represent the distance.\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time taken. Since the goal is to double the average speed, we need to find the speed required to run back that would result in an average speed of 6mph (twice the walking speed).\n\nLet's denote the running speed as 'r'. The time taken to walk to the friend's house is 'd\/3' (distance divided by walking speed), and the time taken to run back is 'd\/r' (distance divided by running speed).\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is then:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance \/ Total time\nAverage speed = 2d \/ (d\/3 + d\/r)\n\nWe want this average speed to be 6mph, so we set up the equation:\n\n6 = 2d \/ (d\/3 + d\/r)\n\nTo solve for 'r', we can simplify the equation:\n\n6 = 2 \/ (1\/3 + 1\/r)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (1\/3 + 1\/r) gives:\n\n6 * (1\/3 + 1\/r) = 2\n\n2 + 6\/r = 2\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides gives:\n\n6\/r = 0\n\nThis equation has no solution, which means that it's not possible to double the average speed by running back at any finite speed.

This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and allows the king to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles of wine into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink a small amount of wine from each bottle in their group.\n3. Wait 24 hours to see which prisoner(s) were affected by the poison.\n4. If only one prisoner was affected, then the poisoned bottle is in their group.

This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from one bottle in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoner, if any, was affected by the poison.\n4. If none of the prisoners were affected, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was not tested. Repeat the process with the remaining group.\n5. If one prisoner was affected, then the poisoned bottle is in their group. Divide that group into 10 subgroups of 10 bottles each and repeat the process with the remaining prisoners.\n6. Continue this process until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time possible, while minimizing the number of prisoners who are exposed to the poison.\n\nOption A is not a viable solution because it would require all prisoners to drink from all 1000 bottles, which would take too long and expose all prisoners to the poison.\n\nOption B is not a viable solution because it would only identify the poisoned bottle after a prisoner has died, which is not ideal.\n\nOption C is not a viable solution because the poison may not have a bitter taste, and relying on taste alone could lead to false positives or false negatives.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"497":{"level_0":497,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The reason is that your opponent has already fired the revolver and no bullet came out. This means that the chamber that was fired was empty. Since there are only five bullets in the revolver, there are only five chambers that contain bullets. The revolver has six chambers, so there is only one empty chamber. Since your opponent has already fired the revolver and the bullet did not come out, the empty chamber has already been used.

This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink a small amount of wine from each bottle in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoner, if any, has been poisoned.\n4. If a prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in their group. If no one dies, then the poisoned bottle is in the remaining 900 bottles.\n5. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles and prisoners until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to narrow down the search for the poisoned bottle quickly and efficiently. It also minimizes the number of prisoners who need to be exposed to the poison.\n\nOption B is not a viable solution because it would require all prisoners to drink from all 1000 bottles, which would be time-consuming and potentially lethal. Option C is not a reliable method because the poison may not have a noticeable taste. Option D is not a viable solution because it would require all prisoners to drink from all 1000 bottles, which would be time-consuming and potentially lethal.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"527":{"level_0":527,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
