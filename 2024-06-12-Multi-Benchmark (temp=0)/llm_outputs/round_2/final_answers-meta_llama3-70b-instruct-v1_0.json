We can't determine the fastest horse with just one race, as we need to compare the horses in pairs to determine which one is faster.\n2.

Since one guardian always tells the truth and the other always lies, we can use this to our advantage.\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\n1. Ask one of the guardians, \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\nThink about it for a moment...\n\nIf you ask the truth-teller, they will tell you what the liar would say, which would be the wrong door. If you ask the liar, they will lie about what the truth-teller would say, which would also point to the wrong door.\n\nSo, regardless of which guardian you ask, the answer will always steer you away from the death door and towards the freedom door.\n\nThis means we can ask only one question to determine which door leads to freedom.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

Option B is not feasible as it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is impractical. Options C and D are also not optimal as they don't utilize the prisoners' \"testing capacity\" efficiently.\n\nThe correct approach is to use a binary search strategy, which is Option A. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle of wine with a binary number from 0 to 999 (using 10 binary digits, since 2^10 = 1024 > 1000).\n2. Assign each prisoner a unique binary number from 0 to 9 (using 4 binary digits, since 2^4 = 16 > 10).\n3. For each bottle, if the i-th binary digit is 1, the prisoner with the corresponding binary number i will drink from that bottle.\n4. After 24 hours, the king will know which prisoners have died.\n5. By analyzing the binary numbers of the dead prisoners, the king can determine the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 5 die, the king can deduce that the poisoned bottle has a binary number with the 1st, 3rd, and 5th digits set to 1.

This is a classic problem of birthday probability.\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity). For a single person, the probability of having a birthday on a specific day is 1\/365.\n\nNow, let's consider a group of people. For the first person, the probability of having a birthday on a specific day is 1\/365. For the second person, the probability of having a different birthday than the first person is 364\/365, since one day is already taken. For the third person, the probability of having a different birthday than the first two is 363\/365, and so on.\n\nTo find the probability that at least two people share a birthday, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability that all people have different birthdays. We can then subtract this probability from 1 to get the probability that at least two people share a birthday.\n\nUsing this approach, we can calculate the probability that at least two people share a birthday for different group sizes. It turns out that with 23 people, the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is greater than 50%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
