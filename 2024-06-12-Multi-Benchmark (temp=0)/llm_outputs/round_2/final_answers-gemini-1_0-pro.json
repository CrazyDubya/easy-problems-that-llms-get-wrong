It's a counterintuitive problem that often leads to confusion, but with careful analysis, the optimal strategy becomes clear.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Choice:** You pick Door No. 1. The probability of the gold bar being behind this door is 1\/3, and the probability of it being behind either of the other two doors is 2\/3 combined.\n2. **Host's Action:** The host, who knows where the gold bar is, opens one of the remaining doors (let's say Door No. 3) to reveal a rotten vegetable. This action doesn't change the probability of the gold bar being behind your initial choice (Door No. 1), which remains at 1\/3.\n3. **Key Insight:** However, the host's action does change the probability distribution for the remaining closed door (Door No. 2). Initially, this door had a 2\/3 chance of hiding the gold bar. Now, since the host revealed a vegetable behind another door, all the remaining probability of the gold being hidden (2\/3) is concentrated on Door No. 2.\n\n### Optimal Strategy:\n\nTherefore, switching to Door No. 2 after the host's action gives you the highest probability of winning the gold bar. By switching, you essentially \"inherit\" the 2\/3 probability that was initially distributed across both unopened doors.\n\n### Answer:\n\nBased on the explanation above, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```\n\n**Door No. 2** gives you the biggest advantage in this scenario. \n","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Analyzing the provided options, we can determine the most efficient approach.\n\n**Discarding Options:**\n\n* **Option B:** This method, while seemingly straightforward, is highly inefficient. Testing each bottle on a separate prisoner would require sacrificing all 10 individuals, regardless of the poisoned bottle's location. \n* **Option C:** While seemingly faster than option B, this approach relies on the prisoners' subjective taste perception. Identifying a subtle bitterness might be challenging, potentially leading to an inaccurate result. Additionally, the prisoners might not experience the full effect of the poison within 24 hours, further jeopardizing the outcome.\n* **Option D:** Similar to option C, this method carries the risk of inaccurate identification due to the subjective experience of the poison's effect. Moreover, sacrificing all prisoners for a single test is an unnecessary loss.\n\n**Optimal Approach:**\n\n* **Option A:** This method utilizes a binary search strategy, a highly efficient technique for identifying the target element within a sorted dataset. By assigning unique binary codes to each prisoner and administering a calculated combination of wine samples, the king can pinpoint the poisoned bottle with minimal testing. This approach guarantees a solution within 24 hours while minimizing the number of tastings and preserving the prisoners' lives.\n\n**Therefore, the optimal answer is: {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}** \n\nThis strategic approach ensures the identification of the poisoned bottle within the given timeframe while minimizing unnecessary risks and maximizing efficiency. \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

While it may seem intuitive that a large group is needed for a high probability of a shared birthday, the reality is that the probability increases rapidly even with a relatively small number of people.\n\nIn this case, we are looking for the minimum number of pairs of twins (which essentially represent two individuals with the same birthday) needed for a 50% chance that at least one other pair shares the same birthday. \n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n* **1 pair:** The probability of another pair sharing the same birthday as the first pair is relatively low, around 1\/365.\n* **12 pairs:** With 12 pairs, the probability of a shared birthday among the remaining 23 individuals increases significantly. Using the complementary probability approach, we can calculate the probability of no shared birthdays as (364\/365)^23, which is approximately 0.493. Therefore, the probability of at least one shared birthday is 1 - 0.493 = 0.507, exceeding the 50% threshold.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **B. 12 pairs**. \n\nIt's important to note that this is the minimum number of pairs needed for a 50% chance. As the number of pairs increases, the probability of a shared birthday continues to rise rapidly. For instance, with 23 pairs, the probability of a shared birthday jumps to approximately 0.569, and with 46 pairs, it reaches a staggering 0.994. \n","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
