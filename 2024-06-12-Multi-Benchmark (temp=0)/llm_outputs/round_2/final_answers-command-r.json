This approach will allow him to pinpoint the poisoned bottle within 24 hours, in time for the event. Binary search is an efficient strategy as it rapidly reduces the search space by half at each iteration.\n\nHere's how it can be implemented:\n1. Number the 1000 bottles from 0 to 999.\n2. Divide the numbers into groups of 10 (the number of prisoners), ensuring each group has a unique number.\n3. Give the prisoners the bottles corresponding to their group. For example, Prisoner 1 gets bottle 0, Prisoner 2 gets bottle 10, and so on.\n4. After 12 hours, have the prisoners open their bottles and taste a small amount.\n5. Since the poison takes effect exactly after 24 hours, check which prisoner is showing signs of poisoning after 12 hours. The corresponding bottle number is the one that was consumed by that prisoner.\n6. If Prisoner 4, for instance, is the first to show signs of poisoning, the poisoned bottle is guaranteed to be within the range from 40 to 49.

When the tree grows to 3kg, the mass of the tree has increased by 1kg. Assuming the mass of the soil has remained constant, we can calculate the remaining soil mass by subtracting the tree's increased mass from the original total: 15kg - 1kg = 14kg.
