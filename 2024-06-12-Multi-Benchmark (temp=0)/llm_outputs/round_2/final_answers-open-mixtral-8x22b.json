This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and allows the king to find the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink a small amount of wine from each bottle in their group.\n3. Wait 24 hours to see which prisoners, if any, are affected by the poison.\n4. If none of the prisoners are affected, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was not tested. Have one of the prisoners drink from each bottle in that group to find the poisoned bottle.\n5. If one or more prisoners are affected, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that they drank from. Divide that group into 10 smaller groups of 10 bottles each and repeat the process with the remaining prisoners.\n6. Continue this process until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to find the poisoned bottle in as few as 7 tests, assuming that the poisoned bottle is in the first group tested. In the worst-case scenario, it would take 10 tests to find the poisoned bottle.\n\nOption B is not a viable solution because it would require all 10 prisoners to drink from all 1000 bottles, which would take too long and could result in multiple prisoners being poisoned.\n\nOption C is not a viable solution because it relies on the prisoners being able to taste the poison, which may not be possible if the poison is tasteless or if the wine is very sweet.\n\nOption D is not a viable solution because it would require the prisoners to drink from potentially poisoned bottles, which could result in multiple prisoners being poisoned.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
