The key is that the host knows what's behind each door and is intentionally offering you the option to switch to a specific door.\n\nInitially, you have a 1\/3 probability of choosing the correct door. The host then reveals a door with rotten vegetables, leaving your original pick and one other closed door.\n\nIf your original choice was correct (1\/3 chance), the host is equally likely to offer either of the other two doors, so switching would make you lose.\n\nHowever, if your original choice was incorrect (2\/3 chance), the host must offer you the door with the gold bar behind it. So by switching, you double your chances of winning from 1\/3 to 2\/3.\n\nTherefore, you should always switch doors when offered the choice, as it gives you a 2\/3 probability of winning compared to 1\/3 if you stick with your original pick.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Each pair of twins shares the same birthday.\n2. We need to find the number of pairs of twins that would make the probability of no two people sharing the same birthday less than or equal to 50%.\n3. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be calculated using the formula: (365 \u00d7 364 \u00d7 363 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 (365 - n + 1)) \/ 365^n, where n is the number of people in the room.\n4. Since each pair of twins counts as two people, we need to find the value of n\/2 (number of pairs of twins) that makes the probability less than or equal to 50%.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate:\n- For 1 pair of twins (2 people): (365 \u00d7 364) \/ 365^2 \u2248 99.7% (much higher than 50%)\n- For 12 pairs of twins (24 people): (365 \u00d7 364 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 342) \/ 365^24 \u2248 53.3% (still higher than 50%)\n- For 23 pairs of twins (46 people): (365 \u00d7 364 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 320) \/ 365^46 \u2248 11.6% (much lower than 50%)\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of pairs of twins needed in a room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday is 23 pairs.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
