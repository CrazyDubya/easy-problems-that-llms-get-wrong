While the bottles aren't literally sorted, we can apply the principle.\n    * **How it Works:**\n        1. **Number the Bottles:** Assign each bottle a number from 1 to 1000.\n        2. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n        3. **Binary Representation:** Think of each prisoner as representing a place value in a binary number (e.g., prisoner 1 is the 'ones' place, prisoner 2 is the 'twos' place, prisoner 3 is the 'fours' place, and so on, up to 1024).\n        4. **Give Wine Based on Binary:** Each prisoner will drink from bottles whose number, in binary, has a '1' in the prisoner's corresponding place value. \n           *  For example, bottle #5 (binary 0000000101) would be given to prisoners 1 and 3.\n        5. **Observe After 24 Hours:** The prisoners who die represent the '1' bits in the binary representation of the poisoned bottle number. \n           *  If prisoners 1 and 3 die, you know the poisoned bottle is #5.\n\n* **Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n    * **B:**  This is highly inefficient and doesn't guarantee finding the poisoned bottle.\n    * **C:** The poison is tasteless, only taking effect after 24 hours.\n    * **D:**  Similar to C, the poison has a delayed reaction, so immediate observation won't help.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
