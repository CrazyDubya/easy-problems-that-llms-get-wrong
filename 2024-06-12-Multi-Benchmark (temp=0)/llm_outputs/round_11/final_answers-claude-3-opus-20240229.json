What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nD.

By treating each prisoner as a binary digit, you can encode up to 2^10 = 1024 combinations, enough to uniquely identify the poisoned bottle among 1000 bottles. For example, prisoner 1 samples bottles 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. Prisoner 2 samples bottles 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. After 24 hours, seeing which prisoners die will directly indicate the binary encoding of the poisoned bottle number. This minimizes the number of tests needed to just 10 prisoners and identifies the exact bottle in 24 hours.\",\n  \"ANSWER\": \"D\"\n}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
