The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, offers you the chance to switch to Door No. 2. Importantly, the host's offer implies that Door No. 2 is not the door with the rotten vegetables that the host would have revealed if you had initially picked Door No. 3.\n\n3. **Switching Strategy**: If you switch to Door No. 2, you are effectively betting that the gold bar is behind one of the two doors you did not initially pick (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3). Since the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge of the contents behind the doors, the probability of winning by switching is 2\/3.\n\n4. **Sticking Strategy**: If you stick with Door No. 1, the probability of winning remains 1\/3.\n\nTherefore, switching doors gives you a higher probability of winning (2\/3) compared to sticking with your initial choice (1\/3).\n\nGiven this analysis, the best choice is to switch to Door No. 2.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"To solve this problem efficiently, we need to leverage the 10 prisoners in a way that allows us to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours. Given that there are 1000 bottles and only 10 prisoners, a direct approach where each prisoner tests a subset of bottles would not be efficient enough. Instead, we can use a binary representation strategy.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0 to 999 (which is 1000 in decimal). This requires 10 bits because \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is enough to cover all 1000 bottles.\n\n2. **Assigning Bottles to Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners will be assigned a position in the binary number (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit). For each bottle, if a bit in its binary representation is 1, the corresponding prisoner will drink from that bottle.\n\n3. **Identifying the Poisoned Bottle**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a unique binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if bottle number 5 (which is 0000000101 in binary) is poisoned, prisoners 1 and 3 (counting from the least significant bit) will die. The binary number formed by the dead prisoners will be 0000000101, which is 5 in decimal, identifying the poisoned bottle.\n\nGiven this strategy, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"To determine how fast you would need to run back to double your average speed for the entire trip, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the distance to your friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_1 \\) be the time taken to walk to your friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_2 \\) be the time taken to run back.\n\n2. **Calculate Time to Walk to Friend's House:**\n   - Speed while walking = 3 mph.\n   - Time to walk to friend's house, \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n3. **Total Distance and Desired Average Speed:**\n   - Total distance for the round trip = \\( 2d \\).\n   - Desired average speed for the entire trip = \\( 2 \\times 3 \\) mph = 6 mph.\n   - Total time for the round trip at the desired average speed = \\( \\frac{2d}{6} = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n4. **Calculate Time to Run Back:**\n   - Total time for the round trip = \\( t_1 + t_2 \\).\n   - We know \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n   - Therefore, \\( t_1 + t_2 = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n   - Since \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\), it implies \\( t_2 = 0 \\) hours.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - To achieve the desired average speed of 6 mph for the entire trip, the time to run back must be zero, which is impossible in practical terms.\n   - This means you would have to run back infinitely fast.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""}}
