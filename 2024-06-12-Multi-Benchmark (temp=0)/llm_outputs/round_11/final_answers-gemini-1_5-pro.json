The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nD. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"D\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is D and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:** Identify one poisoned bottle out of 1000 with only 10 test subjects and a 24-hour time limit.\n\n* **Why A, B, and C are incorrect:**\n    * **A:**  Tasting the poison is not a viable solution as it would likely kill all the prisoners who sample it.\n    * **B:**  This is incredibly inefficient and would require each prisoner to drink from 1000 bottles.\n    * **C:** Similar to A, this would likely kill all the prisoners.\n\n* **Why D is correct: Binary Search**\n\n    1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each bottle a number from 1 to 1000. Convert each bottle number into its binary representation (e.g., Bottle 1 is 0000000001, Bottle 2 is 0000000010, Bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.).\n\n    2. **Prisoners as Bits:** Each prisoner represents a specific 'bit' position in a 10-digit binary number (since 2^10 = 1024, which is greater than 1000). For example:\n        * Prisoner 1: Represents the ones place (2^0)\n        * Prisoner 2: Represents the twos place (2^1)\n        * Prisoner 3: Represents the fours place (2^2)\n        * ...and so on.\n\n    3. **Giving Wine:** For each bottle, give a sip to the prisoners whose corresponding 'bit' position is a '1' in the bottle's binary representation. \n        * Example: Bottle 5 (binary 0000000101) would be sipped by Prisoner 1 and Prisoner 3.\n\n    4. **Decoding the Result:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die.  Construct a binary number based on which prisoners died: '1' if dead, '0' if alive.  This binary number directly translates back to the poisoned bottle number.\n\n* **Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0001000101, which converts to the decimal number 261. Therefore, bottle 261 was poisoned.\n\n* **Efficiency:**  Binary search allows you to test up to 1024 (2^10) items with just 10 tests, making it the most efficient solution. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
