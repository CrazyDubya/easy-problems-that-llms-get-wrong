The farmer can only take one of the three (wolf, goat, or cabbage) across the river at a time since the boat has three separate compartments but needs to manage them to avoid any of them being left alone with their respective predator\/prey.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. The farmer takes the goat across the river first. This is because the goat can't be left with the cabbage or the wolf without supervision. Now, the goat is on the opposite shore, and the wolf and cabbage are on the starting shore. (1 crossing)\n\n2. The farmer returns alone to the original shore to get either the wolf or the cabbage. Let's say he takes the wolf next. He leaves the wolf on the other shore with the goat and takes the goat back to the original shore. This prevents the wolf from eating the goat. Now, the wolf is on the opposite shore, and the farmer, goat, and cabbage are back on the starting shore. (3 crossings)\n\n3. The farmer then takes the cabbage across the river. He leaves the cabbage with the wolf on the opposite shore and returns to the original shore to get the goat. The wolf won't eat the cabbage, so it's safe to leave them together. (5 crossings)\n\n4. Finally, the farmer takes the goat across the river again. Now, all three (wolf, goat, and cabbage) are on the opposite shore, and none have been eaten. (6 crossings)\n\nGiven the steps above, the minimum number of crossings needed to bring the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage across the river without anything being eaten is not directly listed in the provided options.

The classic answer to the original birthday problem is 23 people. However, this question asks about pairs of twins, which introduces a slight twist but doesn't fundamentally change the nature of the problem.\n\nEach pair of twins counts as two people, and since we're looking for the probability of any two people (not necessarily twins) sharing the same birthday, the presence of twins doesn't alter the calculation in the way the question might imply. Therefore, we're essentially looking for the number of individuals needed to reach a 50% chance of a shared birthday, not the number of pairs.\n\nSince the original birthday problem states that 23 people are needed to surpass a 50% chance of sharing a birthday, and this logic applies regardless of whether those people are twins or not, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```\n\nThis is because we're looking for the number of people, not pairs, and 23 people (which could be considered as 11.5 pairs, but since we can't have half a pair, the question's framing is a bit misleading) are needed to reach the threshold of a 50% chance of sharing a birthday.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"To solve this problem, let's first understand what is being asked. The question is about doubling the average speed for the entire trip, which includes both walking to the friend's house and running back.\n\nLet's denote:\n- The distance to the friend's house as \\(D\\) miles.\n- The walking speed as 3 mph, so the time to walk to the friend's house is \\(T_{walk} = \\frac{D}{3}\\) hours.\n- The running speed back as \\(R\\) mph, and we need to find this value.\n- The time to run back as \\(T_{run} = \\frac{D}{R}\\) hours.\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is calculated as the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance for the round trip is \\(2D\\) miles. The total time is \\(T_{walk} + T_{run} = \\frac{D}{3} + \\frac{D}{R}\\).\n\nThe question states that we want to double the average speed of the entire trip compared to just walking to the friend's house. The average speed of walking to the friend's house is 3 mph, so the target average speed for the entire trip is \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) mph.\n\nSetting up the equation for average speed for the entire trip and equating it to 6 mph, we get:\n\\[ \\frac{2D}{\\frac{D}{3} + \\frac{D}{R}} = 6 \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\\[ 2D = 6\\left(\\frac{D}{3} + \\frac{D}{R}\\right) \\]\n\\[ 2D = 2D + \\frac{6D}{R} \\]\n\nSince \\(2D\\) cannot equal \\(2D + \\frac{6D}{R}\\) for any finite value of \\(R\\), it suggests a misunderstanding in the manipulation. The correct approach to find the required speed to double the average speed for the entire trip involves recognizing that the average speed for the entire trip is not simply doubled by doubling the return speed but by ensuring the total time is halved, given the initial average speed was based on walking both ways.\n\nLet's correct the approach:\n\nGiven the initial average speed is to be doubled, we aim for an average speed of 6 mph over the entire trip. However, the mistake was in the algebraic manipulation and the conceptual approach to solving the problem. The key is to realize that doubling the average speed over the entire trip, given the constraints, is not straightforward due to the way average speeds work over different distances and times.\n\nThe correct approach involves understanding that to double the average speed of the entire trip, you cannot simply find a specific finite speed for the return trip without considering the relationship between distance, time, and speed in a more nuanced way. The initial setup led to a confusion in the explanation.\n\nTo actually solve the problem correctly, we need to reconsider the setup and the implications of trying to double the average speed of the entire trip. However, the initial explanation led to a confusion, and the correct solution involves a more detailed analysis of the relationship between the speeds and the times for each leg of the trip.\n\nGiven the mistake in the explanation and the need to provide a clear and correct answer, let's simplify and directly address the question with the correct logic:\n\nIf you walk to your friend's house at 3 mph, to double the average speed for the entire trip to 6 mph, you're essentially trying to make the round trip at an average speed that suggests the return trip needs to be infinitely fast to have no time impact on the average speed calculation. This is because the time taken for the return trip would need to be negligible to achieve the overall doubling of the average speed, considering the way average speed is calculated over the total distance and total time.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""}}
