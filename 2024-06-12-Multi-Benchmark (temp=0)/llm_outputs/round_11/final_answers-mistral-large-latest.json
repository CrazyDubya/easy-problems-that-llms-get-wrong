So, the probability that the gold bar is behind the door you initially chose is still 1\/3, but now the entire 2\/3 probability that it's behind one of the other two doors is concentrated on the remaining unopened door.\n\nSo, switching to the other unopened door gives you a 2\/3 chance of winning, while sticking with your initial choice gives you a 1\/3 chance.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to switch to the other unopened door. However, in your provided answers, there's no option to switch to the unopened door. The options are to stick with Door No.1, switch to Door No.2, or choose Door No.3.

The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nD. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n\nExplanation: The fastest and most efficient way to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy. This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number that requires no more than 10 digits (since there are 1000 bottles and 2^10 = 1024). For example, the first bottle would be 0000000001, the second 0000000010, the third 0000000011, and so on.\n\n2. Assign each prisoner to one of the 10 digits in the binary number.\n\n3. For each test, if the corresponding digit in the bottle's binary number is 1, give the prisoner a sip of the wine. If it's 0, don't give them any.\n\n4. After 24 hours, the prisoners who are still alive correspond to digits that are 0 in the binary number of the poisoned bottle, while the prisoners who have died correspond to digits that are 1.\n\n5. By reading the status of the prisoners (alive or dead) as binary digits, the king can identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing, with results available in 24 hours.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
