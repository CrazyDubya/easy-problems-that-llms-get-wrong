The winner of this race is the fastest of these three, and we can establish their position as the top bit in a binary system. \n\nThe second race pairs up horses 4, 5 and 6.

Binary searching is the most efficient way to find the poisoned bottle, as it reduces the number of tests required, ensuring the king gets the results within the 24 hour window. The concept of binary numbers can be leveraged to conduct this search, requiring each prisoner to only taste a limited number of bottles. \n\nThis strategy works by assigning each bottle a binary number, with 0 representing an even number of bottles and 1 an odd number. The prisoners would then each be given a different starting bottle, with one prisoner testing the first bottle (bottle 0), another testing bottle 2 (1010), another bottle 4 (1100), and so on. All prisoners would taste two bottles of wine, and the king would then identify the poisoned bottle by interpreting the binary number corresponding to the bottle that causes harm. \n\nFor example, if bottle 6 (1110) was poisoned, the prisoner testing bottle 4 (1100) and the prisoner testing bottle 6 would exhibit signs of poisoning 24 hours later. The king could then easily identify the poisoned bottle by interpreting the binary number and finding the corresponding bottle. \n\nThis process would only require 2 rounds of testing, as there are 10 prisoners, and each bottle can be identified by a maximum of 1001 binary numbers.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
