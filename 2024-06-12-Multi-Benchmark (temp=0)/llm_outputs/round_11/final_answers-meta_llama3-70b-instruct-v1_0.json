We can't determine the fastest horse with just one race, because we need to compare the horses to each other. So, we need at least two races.\n2. In the first race, we can race three horses against each other. This will give us a ranking of those three horses.\n3. In the second race, we can race the winner of the first race against the remaining three horses.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"Here's my explanation and answer:\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to understand that the light bulbs are LED and do not get warm when turned on, which eliminates the possibility of using temperature to determine which switch controls which bulb.\n\nThe best approach is to turn each switch on one at a time and observe the bulbs. This way, you can determine which switch controls which bulb by process of elimination.\n\nFor example, you can turn switch A on and observe which bulb turns on. Then, turn switch A off and turn switch B on. If a different bulb turns on, you know that switch B controls that bulb. If the same bulb turns on, you know that switch A and switch B control the same bulb, and you can move on to switch C.\n\nThis approach allows you to determine which switch controls which bulb in a minimum number of steps.\n\nHere's my answer in JSON format:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"17":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"The Poisoned Wine - A king has 1000 sweet bottles of wine, and one contains a very bitter poison.

This means that the king can't rely on the prisoners' taste buds to identify the poison, as it won't take effect immediately.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the poison doesn't take effect immediately, so the prisoners won't be able to taste the difference.\n\nOption B is also incorrect because it would require all prisoners to sample all bottles, which would be impractical and wouldn't guarantee finding the poisoned bottle within 24 hours.\n\nOption C is incorrect for the same reason as Option A - the prisoners won't be able to taste the poison, and even if they did, it wouldn't help the king identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours.\n\nOption D is the correct answer. By using a binary search strategy, the king can divide the 1000 bottles into smaller groups and have the prisoners sample each group.
