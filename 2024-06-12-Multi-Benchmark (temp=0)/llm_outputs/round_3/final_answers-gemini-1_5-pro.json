The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the answer is B and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:** Identify one poisoned bottle out of 1000 with only 10 test subjects and a 24-hour time limit.\n\n* **Why A, C, and D are incorrect:**\n    * **A:**  Tasting the poison is a terrible idea and will likely kill all the prisoners who try it.\n    * **C:**  This is incredibly inefficient and doesn't take advantage of the information you gain from each prisoner's survival or death.\n    * **D:** Similar to C, this is inefficient and risks unnecessary deaths.\n\n* **Why B is correct (Binary Search):**\n\n    1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.  Think of these as place values in a binary number (1, 2, 4, 8, 16... 512).\n    2. **Wine Sampling:** Each bottle of wine is assigned a number from 1 to 1000.  Convert each bottle's number into its binary representation.  If a bottle's binary representation has a '1' in the prisoner's corresponding place value, that prisoner drinks a small sample from that bottle. \n       *  For example, Bottle #5 (binary 0000000101) would be sipped by prisoners #1 and #3. Bottle #12 (binary 0000001100) would be sipped by prisoners #3 and #4.\n    3. **Observation:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die. The binary representation of the poisoned bottle number will be formed by noting which prisoners died.  \n       * For example, if prisoners #1 and #3 die, the binary number is 0000000101, which converts to decimal 5, indicating bottle #5 was poisoned.\n\n* **Efficiency:** Binary search is incredibly efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles in a single iteration. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
