The key to this problem is that the host knows what's behind the doors and will always open a door with rotten vegetables, if possible.\n\nInitially, the probability of the gold bar being behind each door is 1\/3. When you choose a door, say Door No. 1, there's a 1\/3 chance that it has the gold bar. The other two doors combined also have a 1\/3 chance each, totaling to 2\/3.\n\nWhen the host opens another door, say Door No. 3, which has rotten vegetables, the probability doesn't redistribute evenly between the remaining doors. The probability of Door No. 1 remains 1\/3, but the entire 2\/3 probability of the other two doors now shifts to Door No. 2, because Door No. 3 has been revealed to have rotten vegetables.\n\nSo, switching your choice to Door No. 2 gives you a 2\/3 chance of winning the gold bar, which is a higher probability than sticking with your initial choice.\n\nHere's the answer in JSON format:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This strategy allows him to test the maximum number of bottles with the minimum number of prisoners and tests.\n\nHere's how it works: Each prisoner is assigned a binary number from 0 to 9 (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111 in binary). Then, for each bottle of wine, the king checks if the corresponding binary digit is set in the prisoner's number. If it is, the prisoner drinks from that bottle.\n\nFor example, if a prisoner's number is 011 (3 in decimal), they would drink from bottles 1, 2, and 3 (since the second and third binary digits are set). If a prisoner dies, the king knows that the sum of the bottles they drank from equals the number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to test up to 1023 (2^10 - 1) bottles with just 10 prisoners. Since he only has 1000 bottles, he can definitely find the poisoned bottle within 24 hours.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

However, in this case, we're dealing with pairs of twins.\n\nIn the context of this question, I'm assuming that the twins are not identical, meaning they can have different birthdays. If they were identical, the answer would be just one pair of twins.\n\nGiven that assumption, we can treat each twin as an individual person. So, the question becomes: How many individuals do you need in a room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday?\n\nThe classic birthday problem uses the complementary probability principle to solve this. The complementary probability is the probability that no two people share a birthday. This probability decreases as the number of people increases. When the number of people reaches 23, the complementary probability drops below 50%, meaning there's more than a 50% chance that at least two people share a birthday.\n\nSince we're dealing with pairs of twins, and each pair counts as two individuals, we would need 23 individuals, or 12 pairs of twins (23 divided by 2, rounded up because you can't have half a pair).\n\nSo, the answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
