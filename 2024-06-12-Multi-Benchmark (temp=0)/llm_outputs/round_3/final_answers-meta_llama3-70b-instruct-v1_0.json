Option A is not feasible because the poison takes effect 24 hours after consumption, so the prisoners won't be able to taste the bitterness immediately. Option C is also not a good approach because it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is impractical and would likely result in many deaths.\n\nOption D is similar to Option A, but with a 24-hour delay, which still doesn't solve the problem efficiently.\n\nThe correct approach is Option B, which uses a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into two groups of 500 each.\n2. Have one prisoner drink from each bottle in the first group, and another prisoner drink from each bottle in the second group.\n3. Wait 24 hours and observe which prisoners die.\n4. If a prisoner from the first group dies, repeat the process with the 500 bottles from that group. If a prisoner from the second group dies, repeat the process with the 500 bottles from that group.\n5. Continue this process of dividing the remaining bottles into two groups and testing them until you're left with only one bottle that contains the poison.\n\nThis approach uses the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 = 1024 bottles, which is more than enough to cover the 1000 bottles of wine.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

For two people, the probability that they don't share a birthday is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) = 364\/365, since the second person can't have the same birthday as the first person.\n\nFor three people, the probability that they all have different birthdays is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) = 364 \u00d7 363 \/ 365^2.\n\nNotice a pattern? The probability that all people have different birthdays is the product of the probabilities that each person doesn't share a birthday with the previous ones.\n\nNow, let's find the smallest number of people (or pairs of twins) needed for the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday to be at least 50%.\n\nUsing the formula above, we can calculate the probability of all people having different birthdays for different numbers of people:\n\n* 2 people: 364\/365 \u2248 0.9973 (very likely they don't share a birthday)\n* 4 people: 364 \u00d7 363 \u00d7 362 \u00d7 361 \/ 365^4 \u2248 0.9836 (still very likely they don't share a birthday)\n* 6 people: 364 \u00d7 363 \u00d7 362 \u00d7 361 \u00d7 360 \u00d7 359 \/ 365^6 \u2248 0.9595 (getting closer...)\n* 23 people: 364 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 (365-22) \/ 365^23 \u2248 0.4927 (just below 50%)\n\nSo, with 23 people (or 23\/2 = 11.5 pairs of twins), the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is just above 50%.\n\nHowever, since we can't have a fraction of a pair of twins, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
