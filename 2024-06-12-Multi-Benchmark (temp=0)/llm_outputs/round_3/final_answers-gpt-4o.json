Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Choice**: You initially pick Door No. 1. The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, offers you the option to switch to Door No. 2. Importantly, the host's offer implies that Door No. 2 is not the door with the rotten vegetables (if it were, the host would not offer it).\n\n3. **Switching Strategy**: If you switch to Door No. 2, you are effectively betting that the gold bar is behind one of the two doors you did not initially pick (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3). Since the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge of the contents behind the doors, switching increases your chances of winning.\n\n4. **Probability Analysis**:\n   - If you stick with Door No. 1, your probability of winning remains 1\/3.\n   - If you switch to Door No. 2, your probability of winning increases to 2\/3 because the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge that Door No. 2 is not a losing door.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy is to switch to Door No. 2, as it gives you a higher probability of winning the gold bar.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"D\"\n}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"To determine whether you should spin the chambers again, let's analyze the probabilities involved.\n\nInitially, the revolver has six chambers, and five of them are loaded with bullets. This means there is only one empty chamber. When your opponent spins the chambers and fires at himself, he lands on the empty chamber, so there are now five chambers left, all of which are loaded with bullets.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, you will be firing the revolver with the next chamber in sequence. Since there are five bullets and only one empty chamber, the probability of the next chamber being loaded with a bullet is very high.\n\nHowever, if you spin the chambers again, you reset the probabilities. With a fresh spin, there are still six chambers, but only one of them is empty. This gives you a 1 in 6 chance (approximately 16.67%) of landing on the empty chamber.\n\nComparing the two scenarios:\n- Not spinning: 5 out of 5 chambers are loaded (100% chance of hitting a bullet).\n- Spinning: 5 out of 6 chambers are loaded (approximately 83.33% chance of hitting a bullet).\n\nTherefore, spinning the chambers again gives you a better chance of survival because it reduces the probability of firing a loaded chamber.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best choice is to spin the chambers again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. You know that one guardian always tells the truth and guards the death door.\n2. The other guardian always lies and guards the door to freedom.\n\nYou can ask one of the guardians a single question to determine the correct door. The key is to frame the question in such a way that it accounts for both the truth-teller and the liar.\n\nThe question you can ask is: \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\n- If you ask the truth-teller, they will truthfully tell you that the liar would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the liar, they will lie about what the truth-teller would say, and also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the door they indicate will be the death door.

The key constraint is that the bulbs are LED and do not get warm when turned on. This eliminates any method that relies on feeling the warmth of the bulbs to determine which switch controls which bulb.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Turning each switch on one at a time and observing the bulbs.\n- This method would work if you could observe the bulbs directly after each switch is turned on. However, the problem implies that you cannot observe the bulbs directly from the same room.\n\nB. You must walk into another room to observe the bulbs.\n- This option suggests that you can only observe the bulbs from another room. This is a crucial piece of information because it means you cannot see the bulbs while you are operating the switches.\n\nC. Turning two switches on for a while, turn one off, then touching the bulbs to see which is warm and which one is on.\n- This method is invalid because the bulbs are LED and do not get warm when turned on.\n\nD. Turning all of the switches on at once and observing the bulbs.\n- This method would not help you determine which switch controls which bulb because all bulbs would be on simultaneously, and you would not be able to distinguish which switch controls which bulb.\n\nGiven the constraints and the need to observe the bulbs from another room, the best approach is to use a systematic method that allows you to correlate the switches with the bulbs. The most logical approach is:\n\n1. Turn on switch A and leave it on for a while.\n2. Turn on switch B and leave it on for a while.\n3. Turn off switch A.\n4. Walk into the other room to observe the bulbs.\n\n- The bulb that is on corresponds to switch B.\n- The bulb that is off but was recently on corresponds to switch A.\n- The bulb that is off and was never on corresponds to switch C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"17":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"The Poisoned Wine - A king has 1000 sweet bottles of wine, and one contains a very bitter poison.

Given that there are 1000 bottles and 10 prisoners, we can use a binary representation strategy to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nEach bottle can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is more than 1000). We can assign each prisoner to a specific bit position in these binary numbers. For example, prisoner 1 can be responsible for the least significant bit, prisoner 2 for the next bit, and so on up to prisoner 10 for the most significant bit.\n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number from 0000000001 to 1111101000 (1 to 1000 in binary).\n2. Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1.\n3. After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number that directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if the poisoned bottle is number 13 (which is 0000001101 in binary), prisoners 1, 3, and 4 will die (since the binary representation of 13 has 1s in the 1st, 3rd, and 4th positions).\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with a single round of testing, leveraging the binary representation of numbers.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"To determine how fast you would need to run back to double your average speed for the entire trip, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the distance to your friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_1 \\) be the time taken to walk to your friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_2 \\) be the time taken to run back.\n\n2. **Calculate Time to Walk:**\n   - You walk to your friend's house at 3 mph.\n   - Time to walk to your friend's house, \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n3. **Total Distance and Desired Average Speed:**\n   - The total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\).\n   - The desired average speed for the entire trip is double the walking speed, which is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) mph.\n\n4. **Total Time for Desired Average Speed:**\n   - To achieve an average speed of 6 mph for the entire trip, the total time for the round trip should be \\( \\frac{2d}{6} = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n5. **Calculate Time to Run Back:**\n   - The total time for the round trip is the sum of the time to walk to your friend's house and the time to run back: \\( t_1 + t_2 \\).\n   - We already know \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n   - Therefore, \\( \\frac{d}{3} + t_2 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n\n6. **Solve for \\( t_2 \\):**\n   - Subtract \\( \\frac{d}{3} \\) from both sides: \\( t_2 = 0 \\).\n\nThis implies that you would need to run back in zero time to achieve the desired average speed, which is impossible. Therefore, you would need to run back at an infinitely fast speed.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""}}
