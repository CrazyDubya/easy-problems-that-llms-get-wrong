The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n\nExplanation:\nThe fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and allows the king to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink a small amount of wine from each bottle in their group.\n3. Wait 24 hours to see which prisoner(s) were affected by the poison.\n4. If only one prisoner was affected, then the poisoned bottle is in their group. If more than one prisoner was affected, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that both affected prisoners had in common.\n5. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles in the identified group(s) until the poisoned bottle is found.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to narrow down the search quickly and efficiently, using the minimum number of prisoners necessary to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours.\n\nOption A is not feasible because the poison takes 24 hours to take effect, so the prisoners would not be able to identify the poisoned bottle based on taste alone.\n\nOption C is not ethical or practical, as it would require all prisoners to consume potentially lethal amounts of poison.\n\nOption D is not feasible because it would require all prisoners to consume potentially lethal amounts of poison, and the king would not be able to identify the poisoned bottle until after 24 hours had passed.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
