Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Choice**: You initially pick Door No. 1. The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, offers you the chance to switch to Door No. 2. This implies that the host is revealing information indirectly. If the gold bar were behind Door No. 2, the host would not offer you to switch to Door No. 2 if it were a losing door.\n\n3. **Switching Strategy**: If you switch, you are effectively choosing between the two remaining doors (Door No. 2 and Door No. 3). Since the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge of the doors' contents, the probability of winning by switching is higher.\n\n4. **Probability Analysis**:\n   - If you stick with Door No. 1, the probability of winning remains 1\/3.\n   - If you switch to Door No. 2, the probability of winning becomes 2\/3 because the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge that Door No. 1 is more likely to be a losing door.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy is to switch to Door No. 2, as it gives you a higher probability of winning the gold bar.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"ANSWER\": \"A\"\n}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Since your opponent has already fired once and no bullet came out, there is only one empty chamber left. The revolver did not fire, so the chamber that was just fired is now empty. This means that the next chamber in sequence has a bullet. Therefore, if you do not spin again, the probability of firing a bullet is 5 out of 5, or 100%.\n\n### Scenario 2: Spinning Again\nIf you spin the chambers again, you are essentially resetting the probabilities. With 5 bullets in 6 chambers, the probability of firing a bullet is 5 out of 6, or approximately 83.33%.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy comparing the probabilities:\n- Not spinning again: 100% chance of firing a bullet.\n- Spinning again: 83.33% chance of firing a bullet.\n\nClearly, spinning the chambers again gives you a lower probability of firing a bullet.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to spin the chambers again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Here\u2019s the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0000000000 (for bottle 1) to 1111101000 (for bottle 1000). This is because 1000 in binary is 1111101000, which fits within 10 bits (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000).\n\n2. **Assigning Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners can be assigned to a specific bit position in the binary representation of the bottle numbers. For example, prisoner 1 could be responsible for the least significant bit, prisoner 2 for the next bit, and so on up to prisoner 10 for the most significant bit.\n\n3. **Testing Strategy**: Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit in the binary representation is 1. For instance, if a bottle's binary representation is 0000000001, only prisoner 1 will drink from it. If a bottle's binary representation is 0000000011, prisoners 1 and 2 will drink from it.\n\n4. **Interpreting Results**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the exact poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, using the binary results from the 10 prisoners.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The man must clear the top of the hurdle, which means his jump must be at least slightly higher than the height of the hurdle to ensure he doesn't hit it.\n\n- **Option A (Slightly higher than 0.5m)**: This is the most logical choice because the man needs to clear the hurdle, so he must jump slightly higher than 0.5m.\n- **Option B (0.5m)**: This would mean he jumps exactly the height of the hurdle, which is not practical as it doesn't account for any margin of error.\n- **Option C (Between 0.1m and 0.5m)**: This range is too low because it does not reach the height of the hurdle.\n- **Option D (0m)**: This is not possible as he needs to jump to clear the hurdle.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"30":{"category":"Popular science","question":"I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"To determine how fast you would need to run back to double your average speed for the entire trip, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the distance to your friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_1 \\) be the time taken to walk to your friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_2 \\) be the time taken to run back.\n\n2. **Calculate Time to Walk to Friend's House:**\n   - You walk to your friend's house at 3 mph.\n   - Time to walk to your friend's house, \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n3. **Total Distance and Desired Average Speed:**\n   - The total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\).\n   - The desired average speed for the entire trip is double the walking speed, which is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) mph.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Time for Desired Average Speed:**\n   - To achieve an average speed of 6 mph for the entire trip, the total time for the round trip should be \\( \\frac{2d}{6} = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n5. **Determine Time to Run Back:**\n   - The total time for the round trip is the sum of the time to walk to your friend's house and the time to run back: \\( t_1 + t_2 \\).\n   - We already know \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n   - Therefore, \\( \\frac{d}{3} + t_2 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n\n6. **Solve for \\( t_2 \\):**\n   - Subtract \\( \\frac{d}{3} \\) from both sides: \\( t_2 = \\frac{d}{3} - \\frac{d}{3} = 0 \\).\n\nThis implies that the time to run back must be zero to achieve the desired average speed, which is impossible. Therefore, you would need to run back infinitely fast.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""}}
