However, if you initially chose a door with rotten vegetables (which happens 2\/3 of the time), switching doors will always give you the gold bar. This is because the host would never ask you to switch if you initially chose the gold bar (since the host knows where the gold bar is and would not reveal that door).\n\nTherefore, by switching, you effectively get a 2\/3 chance of winning the gold bar, as opposed to sticking with your initial choice, which has a 1\/3 chance of winning.

By asking each current guest to move to the next room (i.e., from room n to room n+1), every guest gets a new room, and the first room (room 1) becomes available for the new guest. This method effectively accommodates an additional guest without needing to find an \"empty\" room in the traditional sense, as the concept of \"fully occupied\" is different when dealing with an infinite number of rooms.\n\nOption A, asking each guest to move to the room number n*2, is another method that works under the premise of accommodating infinitely many new guests by freeing up all odd-numbered rooms, but it's not the most straightforward solution for just one more guest.\n\nOption B, putting the guest in an empty room, assumes there are empty rooms available. In the context of the question, it's implied the hotel is fully occupied (albeit partially full in the sense that it can still accommodate more guests due to its infinite capacity), making this option less directly relevant to the scenario's focus on reassignment.\n\nOption C, stating you cannot accommodate one more guest, is incorrect because, with an infinite number of rooms, the hotel can always accommodate more guests through reassignment strategies.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"26":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A runaway trolley is heading down the tracks away from five people upwards of the track.

We need to find the speed at which you must run back to double the average speed of the entire trip, which includes both walking to your friend's house and running back.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(d\\) as the distance to your friend's house (and thus the total round trip distance is \\(2d\\)),\n- \\(v_1 = 3\\) mph as the speed walking to your friend's house,\n- \\(v_2\\) as the unknown speed running back,\n- \\(T_1\\) as the time it takes to walk to your friend's house,\n- \\(T_2\\) as the time it takes to run back.\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is calculated as the total distance divided by the total time. The goal is to make this average speed double the average speed if you walked both ways at 3 mph.\n\n1. Walking both ways at 3 mph, the average speed would simply be 3 mph. To double this, the average speed of the entire trip needs to be 6 mph.\n\n2. The time to walk to your friend's house is \\(T_1 = \\frac{d}{v_1} = \\frac{d}{3}\\).\n\n3. The time to run back is \\(T_2 = \\frac{d}{v_2}\\).\n\n4. The total distance for the round trip is \\(2d\\).\n\n5. The average speed for the entire trip, aiming to be 6 mph, is calculated as \\(\\frac{Total Distance}{Total Time} = \\frac{2d}{T_1 + T_2}\\).\n\nSetting the average speed to 6 mph, we get:\n\\[\n6 = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{3} + \\frac{d}{v_2}}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(v_2\\), we multiply both sides by the denominator to get rid of the fraction:\n\\[\n6\\left(\\frac{d}{3} + \\frac{d}{v_2}\\right) = 2d\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\n2d + \\frac{6d}{v_2} = 2d\n\\]\n\nSince we aim to find a scenario where the average speed is doubled by running back, and given the setup, it becomes apparent that no finite speed \\(v_2\\) can achieve this because the initial setup assumes a doubling of the average speed simply by the return trip, without considering the mathematical impossibility of achieving such without an infinite speed. The equation simplifies to an impossibility for any finite \\(v_2\\) to satisfy the condition of doubling the average speed to 6 mph under normal circumstances.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, given the impossibility of achieving this with any finite speed, is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""}}
