We can't determine the fastest horse with just one race, because we need to compare the horses in pairs to determine which one is faster. So, we need at least two races.\n2. In the first race, we can compare three horses (let's call them A, B, and C). The winner of this race is the fastest among these three.\n3. In the second race, we can compare the winner of the first race (say, A) with the remaining three horses (D, E, and F). The winner of this race is the fastest among all six horses.\n\nWith these two races, we can determine the fastest horse.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"Here's my explanation and answer:\n\nThe key to this problem is to use the prisoners efficiently to gather information about the bottles of wine. Option A is not feasible because it would require each prisoner to sample 1000 bottles, which is impractical. Option C is also not possible because the poison takes effect 24 hours after consumption, so the prisoners won't be able to taste the bitterness immediately. Option D is similar to Option A and is also not efficient.\n\nThe correct answer is Option B, which uses a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle of wine with a binary number from 0 to 999 (since there are 1000 bottles).\n2. Divide the 10 prisoners into two groups of 5.\n3. For each group, have them sample a subset of bottles corresponding to a specific binary digit (e.g., the first group samples bottles with a 0 in the first binary digit, and the second group samples bottles with a 1 in the first binary digit).\n4. Wait 24 hours and observe which prisoners die.\n5. Based on the results, repeat steps 2-4 for each subsequent binary digit until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just 24 hours using only 10 prisoners.

We want to find the smallest value of x such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%.\n\nThe probability of two people sharing a birthday is 1\/365, since there are 365 possible birthdays (ignoring February 29th for simplicity). The probability of a single person not sharing a birthday with anyone else is therefore 364\/365.\n\nFor a group of 2x people, the probability that no two people share a birthday is (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-2x+1)\/365). This is because each person has a decreasing number of possible birthdays that don't match anyone else's.\n\nWe want to find the smallest x such that the probability of no two people sharing a birthday is less than or equal to 50%. This means we need to find the smallest x such that:\n\n(364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-2x+1)\/365) \u2264 0.5\n\nUsing a calculator or computer to compute this probability, we find that the smallest x that satisfies this condition is x = 23.
