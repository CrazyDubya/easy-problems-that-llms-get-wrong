The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the correct answer is **B** and why the others are incorrect:\n\n* **A is incorrect:** This method would be disastrous, resulting in the death of all prisoners and failing to identify the poisoned bottle. \n* **C is incorrect:** The poison is tasteless, so the prisoners won't be able to identify it by taste.\n* **D is incorrect:**  Similar to option A, this would kill all the prisoners and not provide the necessary information.\n\n**Why B is correct:**\n\nBinary search is the most efficient way to solve this. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Number the bottles:** Assign each bottle of wine a number from 1 to 1000.\n2. **Number the prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n3. **Binary representation:** Think of each prisoner as representing a place value in a binary number (e.g., prisoner 1 is the 'ones' place, prisoner 2 is the 'twos' place, prisoner 3 is the 'fours' place, and so on, up to prisoner 10 representing 2^9).\n4. **Give wine based on binary:**  Each bottle of wine's number will have a unique binary representation.  A prisoner drinks from a bottle if their corresponding binary place value is a '1' in that bottle's binary number. \n   * For example, bottle number 5 (binary 0000000101) would be given to prisoners 1 and 3.\n5. **Observe after 24 hours:** Note which prisoners die. The dead prisoners represent '1's in the binary representation of the poisoned bottle number. The living prisoners represent '0's.\n6. **Decode the binary:**  Construct the binary number based on dead\/alive prisoners and convert it back to decimal to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\n**This method works because you can represent numbers up to 1023 (2^10 - 1) with 10 binary digits. Therefore, 10 prisoners are enough to test up to 1023 bottles.**\" \n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
