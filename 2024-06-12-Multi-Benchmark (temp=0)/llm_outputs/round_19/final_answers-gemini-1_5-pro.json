Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"```json\n{\n\"ANSWER\": \"D\",\n\"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the answer is D and how it works:\n\n* **A and B are incorrect** because they would likely kill all the prisoners. \n* **C is incorrect** because the prompt states the poison is only noticeable after 24 hours.\n\n**D is the optimal solution:**\n\n1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10. Convert each prisoner's number to its binary equivalent (e.g., Prisoner 1 is 001, Prisoner 2 is 010, Prisoner 3 is 011, etc.).  Each digit in the binary number represents a specific wine bottle group.\n\n2. **Wine Assignment:** Each bottle of wine is also given a number from 1 to 1000.  A prisoner will sample a wine if their corresponding binary digit is a '1' for that bottle's number.  For example:\n    * Bottle 1 (0000000001 in binary): Only Prisoner 1 drinks from this bottle.\n    * Bottle 3 (0000000011 in binary): Prisoner 1 and Prisoner 2 drink from this bottle.\n    * Bottle 7 (0000000111 in binary): Prisoner 1, Prisoner 2, and Prisoner 3 drink from this bottle.\n\n3. **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died. Construct a binary number where '1' represents a dead prisoner and '0' represents a living prisoner. This binary number directly translates to the poisoned bottle number.\n\n**Example:** If Prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 011001, which converts to the decimal number 25, indicating bottle number 25 is poisoned.\n\n**Why this works:** This binary strategy allows you to test a large number of items (wine bottles) with a smaller number of tests (prisoners). With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles in a single iteration. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
