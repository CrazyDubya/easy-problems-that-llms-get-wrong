To determine the probability of two people sharing a birthday, we can use the birthday problem formula:\n\nP(no match) = (365\/366)^n\n\nGiven that there are 2 people in a room, P(no match) = 365\/366 * 364\/366. Simplifying this gives us approximately 0.94 or 94%. \n\nTherefore, the probability of a match would be 6% or a 0.06 chance. \n\nTo find the number of pairs of twins needed, we calculate the inverse of 0.06 using the formula: \n\nn = 1\/0.06 \n\nThis gives us approximately 16.67 pairs, which rounds up to 17 pairs. \n\nHowever, to ensure a 50% chance or better, we'd need 18 pairs of twins in the room.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
