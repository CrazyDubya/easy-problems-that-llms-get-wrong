The key is that the host knows what's behind each door and is intentionally offering you the option to switch to a specific door.\n\nInitially, you have a 1\/3 chance of picking the correct door. When the host asks if you want to switch to door 2, he is giving you additional information. \n\nIf you originally picked the correct door (1\/3 chance), the host could offer you either of the other doors, both of which have rotten vegetables.\n\nBut if you originally picked a wrong door (2\/3 chance), the host must offer you the door with the gold bar, since he can't reveal the gold bar and must pick a door with rotten vegetables.\n\nSo by switching doors, you double your chances of winning from 1\/3 to 2\/3. Sticking with your original pick only wins 1\/3 of the time. Therefore, you should always switch doors when given the chance in this scenario.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

By treating the prisoners as bits in a binary number, you can uniquely identify up to 2^10 = 1024 bottles, which is more than enough for the 1000 bottles. For example, prisoner 1 drinks from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. Prisoner 2 drinks from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, etc. After 24 hours, seeing which prisoners have died will directly indicate the poisoned bottle, like bits in a binary number.

Each pair of twins shares the same birthday.\n2. We need to find the number of pairs such that the probability of no two people sharing the same birthday is less than 50%.\n3. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be calculated using the formula: (365 \u00d7 364 \u00d7 363 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 (365 - n + 1)) \/ 365^n, where n is the number of people in the room.\n4. In this case, n = 2 \u00d7 (number of pairs of twins), as each pair consists of two people.\n5. We can start with 1 pair of twins (2 people) and calculate the probability. If it's greater than 50%, we have our answer. If not, we can increment the number of pairs and recalculate until we find the minimum number of pairs that satisfies the condition.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n- For 1 pair of twins (2 people):\n  Probability of no two people sharing the same birthday = (365 \u00d7 364) \/ 365^2 \u2248 0.9973 (99.73%)\n  This is greater than 50%, so 1 pair is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of pairs of twins needed in a room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday is 1 pair.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

By taking action to switch the track, you would be intervening to rescue them from imminent danger. \n\nHowever, the question does not specify whether there are any people on the other track that the trolley would be diverted to. If the other track is empty, then pulling the lever is the clear ethical choice to save five lives. But if there are people on the other track who would be killed by the diverted trolley, then you face an ethical dilemma of whether to take action to save the five but in doing so cause the deaths of others (potentially fewer than five, but the number is unstated).\n\nThis is a version of the famous \"trolley problem\" in ethics, exploring the dilemma of whether it is ethical to take an action that will save a greater number of lives but in doing so directly cause a smaller number of deaths, versus taking no action and allowing the greater number to die. There are arguments on both sides and different ethical frameworks would analyze the dilemma differently.\n\nSince the question does not specify whether the other track has people on it, and since it asks how pulling the lever would impact the five people's lives, I will assume for the sake of this question that the other track is empty.
