Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Choice**: You initially pick Door No. 1. The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, offers you the chance to switch to Door No. 2. Importantly, the host's offer implies that Door No. 2 is not the door with the rotten vegetables (if it were, the host would not offer it).\n\n3. **Switching Strategy**: If you switch to Door No. 2, you are effectively betting that your initial choice (Door No. 1) was wrong. Since the probability that the gold bar is behind one of the other two doors is 2\/3, and the host's offer eliminates one of those doors (the one with rotten vegetables), the probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 2 is 2\/3.\n\n4. **Sticking Strategy**: If you stick with Door No. 1, the probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 remains 1\/3.\n\nTherefore, switching to Door No. 2 gives you a higher probability (2\/3) of winning the gold bar compared to sticking with Door No. 1 (1\/3).\n\nGiven this analysis, the best choice is to switch to Door No. 2.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This means there is one empty chamber. When your opponent spins the chambers and fires, he lands on the empty chamber, leaving five chambers, all of which are still loaded with bullets.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, the revolver is in the same state as it was after your opponent fired: one empty chamber and five loaded chambers. Since the revolver did not fire, the empty chamber is now known to be in one specific position, and the next chamber in sequence is one of the five loaded ones. Therefore, the probability of firing a bullet if you do not spin again is 5\/5 or 100%.\n\nIf you spin the chambers again, you reset the probabilities. The revolver will have six chambers with one empty and five loaded, making the probability of landing on the empty chamber 1\/6 or approximately 16.67%.\n\nGiven these probabilities, it is clear that spinning the chambers again reduces your chances of firing a bullet from 100% to approximately 16.67%.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to spin the chambers again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

The key here is to use a strategy that maximizes the information we can get from the limited number of prisoners.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\nA. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\n- This is not practical because it would result in all prisoners dying if they all sample the poisoned bottle.\n\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\n- This approach is inefficient because it doesn't use the prisoners optimally. With 1000 bottles and only 10 prisoners, it would be impossible to test all bottles within 24 hours.\n\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n- This is not feasible because the poison's effect is not immediate; it takes 24 hours to manifest, so tasting for bitterness won't work.\n\nD. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours.\n- This is the most efficient method. By using a binary representation, each prisoner can represent a bit in a 10-bit binary number (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than enough to cover 1000 bottles). Each bottle can be assigned a unique binary number, and each prisoner drinks from bottles corresponding to the binary digits where they have a '1'.

Therefore, you would need to run back at an infinitely fast speed.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""}}
