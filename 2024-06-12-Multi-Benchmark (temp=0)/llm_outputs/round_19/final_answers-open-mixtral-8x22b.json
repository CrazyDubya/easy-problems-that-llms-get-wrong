The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nC.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n\nExplanation:\nThe fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from one bottle in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours. If none of the prisoners die, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was not tested. If one prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in their group.\n4. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles and prisoners until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to narrow down the search space quickly and efficiently, making it the fastest way to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nAnswer A is not a good option because it would require all prisoners to drink from all 1000 bottles, which would take too long and could result in multiple deaths. Answer B is also not a good option because it would only identify the poisoned bottle after a prisoner has died, which is not ideal. Answer C is not a good option because the poison may not have a bitter taste, and relying on taste alone could result in false positives or negatives.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
