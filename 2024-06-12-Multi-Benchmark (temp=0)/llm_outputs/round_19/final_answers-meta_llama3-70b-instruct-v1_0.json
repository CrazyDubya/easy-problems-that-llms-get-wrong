Since the bulbs are LED and don't get warm when turned on, we can't use temperature to identify them.\n\nOption A, turning all switches on at once, won't help us identify which switch controls which bulb. We'll just see all three bulbs lit up, but we won't know which switch controls which one.\n\nOption D is not relevant, as we don't need to leave the room to observe the bulbs.\n\nOption C is a clever idea, but it's based on a false assumption. Since the bulbs are LED, they won't get warm when turned on, so touching them won't give us any information.\n\nThat leaves us with Option B: turning each switch on one at a time and observing the bulbs. This approach allows us to isolate the effect of each switch and identify which bulb it controls. By turning each switch on and off individually, we can create a one-to-one correspondence between switches and bulbs.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"17":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"The Poisoned Wine - A king has 1000 sweet bottles of wine, and one contains a very bitter poison.

We need to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours, and we have 10 prisoners to help us.\n\nOption A is not feasible because we need to find the poisoned bottle, not just identify that someone died.\n\nOption B is also not efficient because we would need to divide the 1000 bottles among the 10 prisoners, which means each prisoner would need to test around 100 bottles. This would increase the chances of multiple prisoners dying, and we still wouldn't know which bottle is poisoned.\n\nOption C is not possible because the poison takes effect 24 hours after consumption, so the prisoners wouldn't be able to taste the bitterness immediately.\n\nOption D is the correct answer. We can use a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a binary number from 0 to 999 (since 2^10 = 1024, which is greater than 1000).\n2. Divide the prisoners into two groups of 5.\n3. For each group, have them drink a mixture of wine from bottles with a 0 in a specific binary position (e.g., bottles 0, 2, 4, 6, ... for the first group, and bottles 1, 3, 5, 7, ... for the second group).\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners died. If a prisoner from the first group died, the poisoned bottle has a 0 in that binary position. If a prisoner from the second group died, the poisoned bottle has a 1 in that binary position.\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 for each binary position, using the remaining prisoners to test the next position.\n6. After 10 iterations (since we have 10 prisoners), we can reconstruct the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis strategy ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle in 24 hours using the 10 prisoners.\n\nHere's the answer in JSON format:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

For two people, the probability that they don't share a birthday is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) = 364\/365, since the second person can't have the same birthday as the first person.\n\nFor three people, the probability that they don't share a birthday is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) = 364\/365 \u00d7 363\/365.\n\nWe can continue this pattern for n people: the probability that they don't share a birthday is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365).\n\nWe want to find the smallest n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%. This means we need to find the smallest n such that the probability of no one sharing a birthday is less than or equal to 50%.\n\nUsing a calculator or computer, we find that when n = 23, the probability of no one sharing a birthday is approximately 49.3%, which is less than 50%. Therefore, with 23 people in the room, there is at least a 50% chance that two people share a birthday.\n\nNow, let's consider the question: how many pairs of twins do we need in a room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday?

At first glance, it appears to be a simple problem, but the phrase \"infinite number of fully furnished rooms\" adds a twist. \n\nIf the hotel has an infinite number of rooms, it means that there is no such thing as a \"next\" room, as there is always another room after that, and another, and another, ad infinitum. \n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they assume that there is a finite number of rooms, which is not the case. \n\nOption B is also incorrect because it says you cannot accommodate one more guest, but that's not true. You can always accommodate one more guest in an infinite hotel.\n\nThe correct answer is Option C. If you ask each current guest to move to the room number n*2, you will essentially free up all the odd-numbered rooms.
