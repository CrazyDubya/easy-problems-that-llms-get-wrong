The horses that came in 2nd, 3rd, etc., might have different results in a different race.\n* **You need to compare times from different races.** To find the absolute fastest, you need to compare the winners of initial heats to see who has the best time overall.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Race 1:** Divide the horses into two groups of three and race them.\n2. **Race 2:** Race the top three horses from the first race. The winner of this race is the fastest horse overall.\n3. **Race 3:**  Race the top two horses from the first race that didn't win the second race.

With 10 prisoners, you can represent numbers up to 1023 (2^10 - 1). \n    2. **Labeling and Assigning:**  Label each bottle with a number from 1 to 1000. Convert each bottle's number into its binary equivalent.  Each prisoner is assigned a 'place value' in the binary system (e.g., prisoner 1 is the ones place, prisoner 2 is the twos place, prisoner 3 is the fours place, and so on).\n    3. **Tasting:** A prisoner drinks from a bottle if the bottle's binary representation has a '1' in their assigned place value. For example, bottle number 5 (binary 0000000101) would be tasted by prisoners 1 and 3.\n    4. **Decoding the Result:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die. The binary representation of the poisoned bottle is formed by noting which prisoners died.  A '1' represents a dead prisoner, and a '0' represents a living prisoner.\n\n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n    * **B:**  This is highly inefficient and doesn't leverage the 24-hour delay for information.\n    * **C:** The poison is tasteless, only identifiable by its delayed lethal effect.\n    * **D:**  This would kill all prisoners and is not the fastest way to find the poisoned bottle. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
