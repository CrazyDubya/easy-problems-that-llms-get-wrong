Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n\nExplanation:\nThe fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This method minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from one bottle in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoner, if any, was affected by the poison.\n4. If a prisoner was affected, the poisoned bottle is in their group of 100. If no prisoner was affected, the poisoned bottle is in the remaining 900 bottles.\n5. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles, dividing them into groups of 10 and assigning them to the remaining prisoners.\n6. Continue this process until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time possible, while minimizing the number of prisoners needed to test the wine. Option A is not feasible as it would require all prisoners to drink from all 1000 bottles, which is not practical. Option C is not reliable as the poison may not have a noticeable taste. Option D is unethical and would result in the death of a prisoner.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

However, this question asks for the number of pairs of twins needed for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people (not necessarily twins) have the same birthday.\n\nSince twins always share the same birthday, we can simplify the problem by considering each pair of twins as a single entity with a unique birthday. Therefore, we are looking for the number of unique birthdays (pairs of twins) needed to have a 50% chance that at least two entities share the same birthday.\n\nThe classic birthday problem tells us that with 23 people, there is approximately a 50% chance that at least two people share the same birthday.
