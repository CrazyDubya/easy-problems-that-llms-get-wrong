Since there's only one torch, we need to pair people up to cross the bridge together. The key insight is that the slower person in each pair determines the crossing time.\n\nLet's analyze the possible pairings:\n\n1. A and B: A takes 1 minute, B takes 2 minutes, so together they take 2 minutes. A returns with the torch (1 minute). Total time so far: 3 minutes.\n2. A and C: A takes 1 minute, C takes 5 minutes, so together they take 5 minutes. A returns with the torch (1 minute). Total time so far: 6 minutes.\n3. A and D: A takes 1 minute, D takes 10 minutes, so together they take 10 minutes. A returns with the torch (1 minute). Total time so far: 11 minutes.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining pairings:\n\n1. B and C: B takes 2 minutes, C takes 5 minutes, so together they take 5 minutes.\n2. B and D: B takes 2 minutes, D takes 10 minutes, so together they take 10 minutes.\n3. C and D: C takes 5 minutes, D takes 10 minutes, so together they take 10 minutes.\n\nThe fastest option is to pair A with B, then A returns with the torch, and finally C and D cross together. This sequence takes: 2 minutes (A and B) + 1 minute (A returns) + 10 minutes (C and D) = 13 minutes.\n\nHowever, we can optimize this further. Instead of having A return with the torch, we can have B return with the torch (since B is faster than A). This saves 1 minute. The revised sequence takes: 2 minutes (A and B) + 1 minute (B returns) + 10 minutes (C and D) = 13 minutes - 1 minute = 12 minutes.\n\nBut wait, there's another optimization! After A and B cross, A can stay on the other side, and B can return with the torch. Then, C and D can cross together, and finally, B can cross again. This sequence takes: 2 minutes (A and B) + 2 minutes (B returns) + 5 minutes (C and D) + 2 minutes (B crosses again) = 11 minutes.\n\nThis is the fastest possible sequence, but it's not among the answer choices.

Option A is not feasible because it would require each prisoner to sample 1000 bottles, which is impractical. Option C is also not possible because the poison takes effect 24 hours after consumption, so the prisoners won't be able to taste the bitterness immediately. Option D is similar to Option A and is also not efficient.\n\nThe correct answer is Option B, which uses a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle of wine with a binary number from 0 to 999 (since there are 1000 bottles).\n2. Divide the 10 prisoners into two groups of 5.\n3. For each group, have them sample a subset of bottles corresponding to a specific binary digit (e.g., the first group samples bottles with a 0 in the first binary digit, and the second group samples bottles with a 1 in the first binary digit).\n4. Wait 24 hours and observe which prisoners die.\n5. Based on the results, repeat steps 2-4 for each subsequent binary digit until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just 24 hours using only 10 prisoners.

Let's call the time it takes me to walk to my friend's house \"t\". Then, the time it takes me to run back is t - t = t\/2.\n5.
