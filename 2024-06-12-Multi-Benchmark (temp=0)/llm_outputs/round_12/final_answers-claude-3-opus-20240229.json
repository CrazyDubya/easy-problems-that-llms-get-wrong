By treating each prisoner as a binary digit, you can encode up to 2^10 = 1024 combinations, enough to uniquely identify the poisoned bottle among 1000 bottles. For example, prisoner 1 samples bottles 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. Prisoner 2 samples bottles 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. After 24 hours, seeing which prisoners die will directly indicate the binary encoding of the poisoned bottle number.
