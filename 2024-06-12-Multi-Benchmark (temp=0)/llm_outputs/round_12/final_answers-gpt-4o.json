This means there is only one empty chamber. When your opponent spins the chambers and fires, he lands on the empty chamber, leaving five chambers, all of which are loaded with bullets.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, you know that the next chamber in sequence is one of the five loaded chambers.

Here\u2019s the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each of the 1000 bottles can be represented by a unique binary number from 0000000000 (for bottle 0) to 1111101000 (for bottle 999). This requires 10 bits because \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is enough to cover all 1000 bottles.\n\n2. **Assigning Tests**: Each prisoner can be assigned to a specific bit position in the binary representation of the bottle numbers. For example, prisoner 1 could be responsible for the least significant bit, prisoner 2 for the next bit, and so on up to prisoner 10 for the most significant bit.\n\n3. **Testing Strategy**: Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1. For instance, if a bottle's binary representation is 0101010101, then prisoners 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 will drink from that bottle.\n\n4. **Interpreting Results**: After 24 hours, the pattern of which prisoners die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, using the binary results from the 10 prisoners.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is because the number of possible pairs of people grows rapidly with the size of the group.\n\nNow, let's consider pairs of twins.

Therefore, if we have \\( n \\) pairs of twins, it is equivalent to having \\( 2n \\) individuals.\n\nTo find the number of pairs of twins needed for a 50% chance that at least two people have the same birthday, we need to find \\( n \\) such that \\( 2n \\) individuals have a 50% chance of sharing a birthday.\n\nFrom the birthday paradox, we know that 23 individuals give us about a 50% chance.
