You have 3 light bulbs in front of you in the same room - one red, one blue, one purple. They are LED and do not get warm when turned on. You want to know which switch turns on which light bulb. What is the best way to determine this?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Turing two switches on for a while, turn one off, then touching the bulbs too see which is warm and which one is one.\nB. Turing all of the switches on at once and observing the bulbs.\nC. Turing each switch on one at a time and observing the bulbs.\nD. You must walk into another room to observe the bulbs.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"A\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why option A is the most effective:\n\n* **Heat as an Indicator:**  Traditional incandescent bulbs produce heat when turned on. By leaving two switches on for a while, you heat up two bulbs. Turning one switch off lets you identify:\n    * **The bulb still on:** Connected to the switch that's still on.\n    * **The warm bulb that's off:** Connected to the switch you just turned off.\n    * **The cold bulb:** Connected to the switch you never touched.\n\n**Why other options are less effective:**\n\n* **B:** Turning all switches on simultaneously doesn't give you enough information to match each switch to its bulb.\n* **C:**  While you'll see which bulb lights up with each switch, you won't be able to differentiate them if you turn a switch off and then back on.\n* **D:** Observing from another room provides no additional information to solve the problem.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"17":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"The Poisoned Wine - A king has 1000 sweet bottles of wine, and one contains a very bitter poison.
