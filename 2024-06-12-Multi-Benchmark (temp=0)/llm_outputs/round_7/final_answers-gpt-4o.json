Given the constraints:\n\n1. One guardian always tells the truth and guards the death door.\n2. The other guardian always lies and guards the freedom door.\n\nYou can use a well-known logical trick to determine the correct door with just one question. The trick is to ask either guardian a question that forces them to reveal the truth regardless of their nature (truth-teller or liar).\n\nHere's the question you can ask either guardian:\n\"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would they point to?\"\n\n- If you ask the truth-telling guardian, they will truthfully tell you that the lying guardian would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the lying guardian, they will lie about the truth-telling guardian's response, and thus also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the door they point to will be the death door. Therefore, you should choose the opposite door to ensure your safety.\n\nThus, the minimum number of questions needed to determine the door to freedom is one.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\n- This method is not efficient because it would require more than 10 prisoners to test all 1000 bottles individually.\n\nB.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"To determine how fast you would need to run back to double your average speed for the entire trip, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the distance to your friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_1 \\) be the time taken to walk to your friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_2 \\) be the time taken to run back.\n\n2. **Calculate Time to Walk:**\n   - You walk to your friend's house at 3 mph.\n   - Time to walk to your friend's house, \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n3. **Total Distance and Desired Average Speed:**\n   - The total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\).\n   - To double the average speed for the entire trip, the desired average speed is \\( 2 \\times 3 \\) mph = 6 mph.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Time for Desired Average Speed:**\n   - The total time for the round trip to achieve an average speed of 6 mph is \\( \\frac{2d}{6} = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n5. **Calculate Time to Run Back:**\n   - The total time for the round trip is the sum of the time to walk to your friend's house and the time to run back: \\( t_1 + t_2 \\).\n   - We know \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( \\frac{d}{3} + t_2 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n\n6. **Solve for \\( t_2 \\):**\n   - Subtract \\( \\frac{d}{3} \\) from both sides: \\( t_2 = 0 \\).\n\nThis implies that you would need to run back in zero time to achieve the desired average speed of 6 mph for the entire trip, which is impossible. Therefore, you would need to run back infinitely fast.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""}}
