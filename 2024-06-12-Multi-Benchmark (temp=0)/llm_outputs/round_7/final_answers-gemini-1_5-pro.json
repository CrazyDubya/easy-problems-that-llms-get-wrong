The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"D\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the answer is D and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:**  The king needs to find a single poisoned bottle out of 1000, and he only has time for one round of testing (since the poison takes 24 hours to work).\n\n* **Why other options won't work:**\n    * **A & C:**  These are unethical and inefficient.  You'd be risking the lives of all prisoners without a guaranteed solution.\n    * **B:** The poison is stated to be very bitter, but there's no guarantee the prisoners could distinguish it from the sweetness of the wine reliably.\n\n* **Solution: Binary Search**\n\n    1. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n    2. **Number the Bottles:**  Imagine each bottle of wine is numbered from 1 to 1000. Convert each bottle number into its binary representation (e.g., bottle 1 is 0000000001, bottle 2 is 0000000010, bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.).\n    3. **Assign Wine:** Each prisoner will drink from bottles based on their corresponding binary digit. For example:\n        * Prisoner 1: Drinks from every bottle where the *last* binary digit is a 1.\n        * Prisoner 2: Drinks from every bottle where the *second to last* binary digit is a 1.\n        * ...and so on.\n    4. **Observe After 24 Hours:**  Note which prisoners die. If a prisoner dies, it means a '1' was in their corresponding position in the binary representation of the poisoned bottle number. If they live, it was a '0'.\n    5. **Construct the Binary Number:**  Create a binary number based on the dead\/alive status of the prisoners. For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number would be 0001100001.\n    6. **Convert to Decimal:** Convert the resulting binary number back into decimal form. This decimal number will be the poisoned bottle.\n\n* **Why Binary Search is Optimal:** Binary search is incredibly efficient for searching through a large set of possibilities. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles simultaneously. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
