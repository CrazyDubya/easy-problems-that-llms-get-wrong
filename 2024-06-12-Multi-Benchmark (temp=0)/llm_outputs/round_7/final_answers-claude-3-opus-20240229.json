The key is that the host knows what's behind the doors and always opens a door with rotten vegetables, never the gold bar.\n\nInitially, you have a 1\/3 chance of picking the gold bar. The host then opens one of the other doors, revealing rotten vegetables. The host is giving you additional information.\n\nSwitching doors now gives you a 2\/3 chance of winning the gold bar. Here's why:\n- If you initially picked the gold bar (1\/3 chance), switching loses.\n- If you initially picked rotten vegetables (2\/3 chance), switching wins.\n\nSo by switching, you win if your initial choice was wrong, which happens 2\/3 of the time. Sticking with your original pick wins only if you were right the first time, which is only a 1\/3 chance.\n\nTherefore, switching to door No. 2 gives you the biggest advantage.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

By treating the prisoners as bits in a 10-bit binary number, you can uniquely identify up to 1024 bottles by which prisoners die after 24 hours. For example, bottle 1 is represented by prisoner 1 drinking it, bottle 2 by prisoner 2, bottle 3 by prisoners 1 and 2, bottle 4 by prisoner 3, and so on. After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who died will directly indicate the number of the poisoned bottle in binary. This is much more efficient than having prisoners drink from all 1000 bottles or dividing the bottles evenly among them.\",\n  \"ANSWER\": \"D\"\n}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
