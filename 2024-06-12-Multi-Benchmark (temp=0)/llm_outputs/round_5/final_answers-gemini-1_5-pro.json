This action doesn't change the initial odds that your first choice was wrong (which was 2\/3).  Crucially, the host's knowledge of where the gold bar is allows them to concentrate the probability of the unopened door you didn't initially choose.\n* **The Switch:** When you switch to Door No. 2, you're essentially taking advantage of the 2\/3 probability that the gold bar was initially behind one of the doors you *didn't* pick.

The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nD. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"A\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is A and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:** The king needs to find *one* poisoned bottle out of 1000, and he only has time for one round of testing (since the poison takes 24 hours to work).\n\n* **Why A is Correct (Binary Search):**\n    * **Efficiency:** Binary search is the most efficient way to search a sorted set of data.  While the bottles aren't literally sorted, we can apply the principle of halving the search space.\n    * **How it Works:**\n        1. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n        2. **Number the Bottles:**  Think of each bottle as having a number from 1 to 1000. Convert these numbers to their binary representation (e.g., bottle 1 is 0000000001, bottle 2 is 0000000010, bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.).\n        3. **Assign Wine:** Each prisoner will drink from bottles based on their corresponding binary digit. For example:\n            * Prisoner 1: Drinks from every bottle where the *last* binary digit is a 1.\n            * Prisoner 2: Drinks from every bottle where the *second to last* binary digit is a 1. \n            * ...and so on.\n        4. **Observe:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die.  \n        5. **Decode the Bottle:** Create a binary number where a '1' represents a dead prisoner and a '0' represents a living prisoner. Convert this binary number back to decimal form to get the poisoned bottle number.\n\n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    * **B:** This is inefficient and only tests 10 bottles.\n    * **C:** The poison is explicitly stated as tasteless.\n    * **D:**  Logistically impossible \u2013 each prisoner would need to drink from 1000 bottles.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
