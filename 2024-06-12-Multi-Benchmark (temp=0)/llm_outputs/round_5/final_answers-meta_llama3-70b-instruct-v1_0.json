Since the poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption, we can use a binary search strategy to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Assign a unique binary number to each prisoner, from 0000000000 to 1111111111 (10 digits, 2^10 = 1024, which is greater than 1000).\n2. Label each bottle of wine with a unique number from 1 to 1000.\n3. For each prisoner, have them drink from the bottles corresponding to the positions in their binary number where the digit is 1. For example, prisoner 0000000001 would drink from bottles 1 and 1000, while prisoner 0000000010 would drink from bottles 2 and 1000.\n4. Wait 24 hours and observe which prisoners die.\n5. Use the binary numbers of the dead prisoners to determine which bottle is poisoned. Since each prisoner's binary number is unique, the intersection of the dead prisoners' numbers will identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis strategy ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing, using all 10 prisoners.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is a classic problem of birthday probability.\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n\nFor a single person, the probability of having a birthday on any given day is 1\/365.\n\nFor two people, the probability that they have different birthdays is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) = 364\/365, since the second person can't have the same birthday as the first. The probability that they have the same birthday is therefore 1 - 364\/365 = 1\/365.\n\nNow, let's consider a room with n people. We want to find the smallest n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%.\n\nUsing the complementary probability, we can calculate the probability that all n people have different birthdays:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365) = 365! \/ (365^n \u00d7 (365-n)!)\n\nWe want this probability to be less than or equal to 50%, so we can set up the inequality:\n\n365! \/ (365^n \u00d7 (365-n)!) \u2264 0.5\n\nSolving for n, we find that n \u2265 23.\n\nTherefore, we need at least 23 people in the room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n\nSince we're looking for pairs of twins, we need 23 pairs, which is equivalent to 46 people.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
