This method minimizes the number of tests needed and allows the king to find the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from the bottles in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoner, if any, was affected by the poison.\n4. If a prisoner was affected, the poisoned bottle is in their group. If no prisoner was affected, the poisoned bottle is in the remaining group of 100 bottles.\n5. Repeat the process with the remaining group of 100 bottles, dividing them into 10 groups of 10 bottles each and assigning them to the prisoners.\n6. Continue this process until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis method allows the king to narrow down the search quickly and efficiently, using the minimum number of prisoners necessary.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Since twins share the same birthday, we can simplify the problem by considering each pair of twins as a single person with a unique birthday.\n\nTherefore, we can use the birthday paradox formula with N being the number of pairs of twins.

By putting the guest in an empty room. This is not necessarily true, as we don't know if there are any empty rooms available.\n\nB. You ask each current guest to move to the room number n*2.
