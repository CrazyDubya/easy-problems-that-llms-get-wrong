What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"Here is my analysis:\n\nThe key to solving this efficiently is to use the 10 prisoners strategically to test multiple bottles at once and narrow down the poisoned bottle as quickly as possible in a single 24 hour period.\n\nA and D won't work because dividing the 1000 bottles among only 10 prisoners would require each prisoner to drink from 100 bottles, which would likely kill all of them. And the poison is bitter, but the question states the wine itself is sweet, so taste alone won't identify the poison.\n\nC is very inefficient, requiring each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles. Most of the prisoners would die from the poisoned bottle.\n\nB is the optimal approach. By numbering the bottles from 1 to 1000 and representing each number as a 10-digit binary number, each prisoner can be assigned to one of the 10 digit positions. Each prisoner then drinks from the bottles that have a 1 in their assigned digit position. After 24 hours, the prisoners that die will reveal the binary encoding of the poisoned bottle number. This allows testing 1000 bottles with only 10 prisoners in one 24 hour period.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
