Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the answer is B and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:**  The king needs to test 1000 bottles with only 10 prisoners and one chance to observe the results (after 24 hours).\n\n* **Why A, C, and D are incorrect:**\n    * **A & C:** These methods would likely kill all the prisoners as they don't offer a systematic way to isolate the poison.\n    * **D:**  The poison is stated to be tasteless, only taking effect after 24 hours.\n\n* **Why B is correct (Binary Search):**\n\n    1. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n\n    2. **Number the Bottles:**  Imagine each bottle has a number from 1 to 1000. Convert these numbers to their binary representation (e.g., bottle 1 is 0000000001, bottle 2 is 0000000010, bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.).\n\n    3. **Assign Wine Based on Binary:** Each prisoner will drink from bottles based on their corresponding binary digit. \n        * For example:\n            * Prisoner 1 (representing the 'ones' place in binary) drinks from every bottle with a '1' in the ones place of its binary representation.\n            * Prisoner 2 (representing the 'twos' place in binary) drinks from every bottle with a '1' in the twos place of its binary representation. \n            * ...and so on.\n\n    4. **Observe After 24 Hours:**  Note which prisoners die. The dead prisoners represent '1's in the binary code, and the living prisoners represent '0's. Construct the binary number based on who died.  \n\n    5. **Identify the Poisoned Bottle:** Convert the resulting binary number back to decimal form. This decimal number is the poisoned bottle.\n\n* **Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary code is 0010100001, which converts to the decimal number 657. Bottle 657 is poisoned.\n\n* **Efficiency:** Binary search is incredibly efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles in a single round. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
