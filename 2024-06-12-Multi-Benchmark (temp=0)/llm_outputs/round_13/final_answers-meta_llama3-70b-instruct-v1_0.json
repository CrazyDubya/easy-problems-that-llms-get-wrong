We can't determine the fastest horse with just one race, as we need to compare the horses to each other.\n2. If we race two horses at a time, we can narrow it down to the top two horses in two races. Then, we can race these two horses against each other to determine the fastest horse. This would require a total of three races.\n\nHowever, we can do better than this. Here's a more efficient approach:\n\n1. Divide the six horses into three pairs and race each pair against each other. This takes three races.\n2. Take the winners of each pair and race them against each other. This takes one more race.\n3. The winner of this final race is the fastest horse.\n\nThis approach requires a total of four races.

However, since the bulbs are LED and don't get warm, this approach won't work.\n\nThe best approach is Option B: turning each switch on one at a time and observing the bulbs. This allows us to gather information about each switch individually and eliminate possibilities. For example, if we turn switch A on and the red bulb turns on, we know that switch A controls the red bulb. We can then turn switch A off and turn switch B on, and if the blue bulb turns on, we know that switch B controls the blue bulb. We can repeat this process for switch C, and by process of elimination, we can determine which switch controls the purple bulb.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"17":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"The Poisoned Wine - A king has 1000 sweet bottles of wine, and one contains a very bitter poison.

Since the poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption, we can use a binary search strategy to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle of wine with a binary number from 0 to 999 (since there are 1000 bottles).\n2. Divide the prisoners into two groups of 5.\n3. For each group, have them drink a mixture of wine from bottles with a 0 in a specific binary position (e.g., bottles 0, 2, 4, 6, ... for the first group, and bottles 1, 3, 5, 7, ... for the second group).\n4. Wait 24 hours and observe which prisoners die.\n5. Based on the results, eliminate half of the bottles from consideration (since the poison can only be in one of the two groups).\n6.

This is because there are more opportunities for birthdays to overlap.\n\nUsing the formula for the birthday problem, we can calculate the probability that at least two people share a birthday as:\n\nP(at least two share a birthday) = 1 - P(no one shares a birthday)\n\nwhere P(no one shares a birthday) is the probability that all pairs of twins have distinct birthdays.\n\nAfter some calculations, we find that with 23 pairs of twins (46 people), the probability that at least two people share a birthday is approximately 50.7%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
