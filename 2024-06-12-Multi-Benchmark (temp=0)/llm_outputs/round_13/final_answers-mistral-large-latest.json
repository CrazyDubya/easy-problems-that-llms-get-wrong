This strategy allows him to test multiple bottles at once, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000 (which requires 10 digits since 2^10 = 1024).\n2. Assign each digit position to a different prisoner.\n3. If the digit in a prisoner's position is 1, have them drink from the bottle.\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners have died. The combination of their positions will correspond to the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 8 die, the poisoned bottle would be labeled with the binary number 1000 (which corresponds to the decimal number 8).\n\nThis method allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing, with results available in 24 hours.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

However, in this case, we are dealing with pairs of twins.\n\nIn the context of this question, I'm assuming that the twins are not identical (i.e., they don't necessarily share the same birthday). If this is the case, then each pair of twins can be considered as two individuals.\n\nThe classic birthday problem is a well-known problem in probability theory. The counter-intuitive result is that you only need 23 people in a room for there to be a 50% chance that at least two people have the same birthday. This is because the probability that each new person does not share a birthday with any of the people already in the room decreases with each additional person.\n\nSo, if we apply this to the twins scenario, where each pair of twins is considered as two individuals, we would still need 23 individuals, or 11.5 pairs of twins.
