Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n\nExplanation:\nThe fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This method minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from the bottles in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoners, if any, were affected by the poison.\n4. If none of the prisoners were affected, then the poisoned bottle is in the remaining group of 100 bottles.\n5. If one prisoner was affected, then the poisoned bottle is in their group of 100 bottles.\n6. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles and prisoners, dividing the bottles into smaller groups each time until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time possible, using only 10 prisoners.\n\nOption A is not ideal because it would require the king to wait for 24 hours for each test, which would take too long. Option C is not ethical and would also take too long. Option D is not reliable because the poison may not have a bitter taste.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
