You are then given the option to stick with your original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Choice**: When you first pick a door, you have a 1\/3 chance of picking the door with the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance of picking a door with rotten vegetables.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host then opens one of the other two doors, revealing a rotten vegetable.

Ask either guardian: \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would they point to?\"\n\n- If you ask the truth-teller, they will truthfully tell you that the liar would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the liar, they will lie about the truth-teller's response and also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the door they point to will be the death door.

Given that we have 10 prisoners and 1000 bottles, we can leverage the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0000000000 (0 in decimal) to 1111101000 (999 in decimal). This gives us a 10-bit binary number for each bottle.\n\n2. **Assigning Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners can be assigned to a specific bit position in the binary representation of the bottle numbers. For example, Prisoner 1 can be assigned to the least significant bit (2^0), Prisoner 2 to the next bit (2^1), and so on up to Prisoner 10 who is assigned to the most significant bit (2^9).\n\n3. **Testing Strategy**: Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1. For instance, if a bottle's binary representation is 1010101010, then Prisoners 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 will drink from that bottle.\n\n4. **Identifying the Poisoned Bottle**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, using the binary representation of the bottle numbers and the 10 prisoners.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The man must jump at least as high as the hurdle to clear it. Therefore, the minimum height he could have jumped is exactly 0.5m. Any height less than 0.5m would not allow him to clear the hurdle.\n\nGiven the options:\n- A. Slightly higher than 0.5m: This is not the minimum height; it's slightly more than necessary.\n- B. 0m: This is not possible as he needs to jump to clear the hurdle.\n- C. Between 0.1m and 0.5m: This range includes heights that are less than 0.5m, which would not clear the hurdle.\n- D. 0.5m: This is the exact height of the hurdle and the minimum height needed to clear it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"30":{"category":"Popular science","question":"I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.

This implies that you would need to run infinitely fast to achieve this.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""}}
