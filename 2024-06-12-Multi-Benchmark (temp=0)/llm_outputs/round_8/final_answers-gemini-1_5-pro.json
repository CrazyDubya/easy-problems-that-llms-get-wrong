The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"A\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is A and why the others are incorrect:\\n\\n* **A. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours**\\n   This is the most efficient method. Here's how it works:\\n    1. **Number the prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\\n    2. **Number the bottles:** Assign each bottle a binary number from 0000000001 (1) to 1111101000 (1000).\\n    3. **Prepare the samples:**  Each prisoner will drink from a set of bottles corresponding to the '1' digits in their assigned binary number. For example, prisoner #3 (binary 0000000011) drinks from bottle 1 and bottle 2.\\n    4. **Observe after 24 hours:** The binary representation of the poisoned bottle number will be revealed by which prisoners die. If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the poisoned bottle is 0000100001 (binary) or bottle number 513.\\n\\n* **B. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.**\\n   This strategy fails if multiple bottles are poisoned or if the poison takes the full 24 hours to take effect.\\n\\n* **C. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.**\\n   This is highly inefficient and doesn't guarantee finding the poisoned bottle.\\n\\n* **D. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.**\\n   This assumes the poison is immediately detectable by taste, which is not stated in the problem. Additionally, it risks killing all the prisoners.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
