The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, will always open one of the doors you did not pick (either Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) to reveal a rotten vegetable. This action does not change the initial probabilities but provides additional information.\n\n3. **Switching vs. Staying**:\n   - If you **stay** with your initial choice (Door No. 1), the probability of winning the gold bar remains 1\/3.\n   - If you **switch** to the other unopened door (in this case, Door No. 2), the probability of winning the gold bar is 2\/3. This is because the host's action of revealing a rotten vegetable behind one of the other doors effectively consolidates the 2\/3 probability of the gold bar being behind one of the other two doors into the single remaining unopened door.\n\nTherefore, switching doors gives you a higher probability of winning the gold bar.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best choice is to switch to Door No. 2.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"ANSWER\": \"C\"\n}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

The trick is to ask either guardian the following question:\n\n\"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would they point to?\"\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n- If you ask the truth-telling guardian, they will truthfully tell you that the lying guardian would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the lying guardian, they will lie about the truth-telling guardian's answer, and also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the door they point to will be the death door.

This is the most efficient method because it allows us to test all 1000 bottles with just 10 prisoners. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Number each bottle from 1 to 1000.\n2. Convert each bottle number to a 10-bit binary number (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000).\n3. Assign each bit position to a prisoner. For example, the first prisoner is responsible for the least significant bit, the second prisoner for the next bit, and so on up to the 10th prisoner who is responsible for the most significant bit.\n4. Have each prisoner drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is 1. For example, if a bottle's binary number is 101 (which is 5 in decimal), the prisoners responsible for the 1st and 3rd bits will drink from that bottle.\n5. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners are affected by the poison. The combination of affected prisoners will form a binary number that corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the exact poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, making it the fastest and most efficient approach.\n\nOptions B, C, and D are less efficient:\n- B involves dividing the bottles among prisoners, but it doesn't specify a systematic way to identify the poisoned bottle efficiently.\n- C suggests all prisoners sample each bottle, which is impractical and doesn't leverage the limited number of prisoners effectively.\n- D involves tasting for bitterness, which is not reliable since the poison's effect is delayed by 24 hours.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This implies that I would need to run back infinitely fast.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""}}
