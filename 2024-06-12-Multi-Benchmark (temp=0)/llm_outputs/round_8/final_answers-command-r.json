To determine the probability of two people sharing a birthday, we can use the formula for combinations: C(n, r) = r!(n\u22121)! \/ r+n\u22121!. With 2 people in the room, the chance of them having the same birthday is C(366, 2) = 183 x 365 \/ 2 x 366. \n\nFor this probability to exceed 50%, we'd require more than 12 people in the room. So, with 12 pairs of twins, the probability would be close to 55%, thus answering C is correct.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
