This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from the bottles in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoner(s) were affected by the poison.\n4. If only one prisoner was affected, then the poisoned bottle is in their group. If more than one prisoner was affected, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was common to all affected prisoners.\n5. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles in the identified group(s) until the poisoned bottle is found.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to narrow down the search space quickly and efficiently, using the minimum number of prisoners necessary. Option B is not ideal because it risks the lives of all prisoners, and option C is not feasible because it would require each prisoner to drink from all 1000 bottles, which is not possible in 24 hours. Option D is not reliable because the poison may not have a noticeable taste.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
