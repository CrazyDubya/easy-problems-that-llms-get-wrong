This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Each prisoner can be thought of as a bit in a binary number, and by carefully assigning bottles to prisoners, the king can identify the poisoned bottle in a single day.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique number from 0 to 999, which can be represented in binary using 10 digits (because 10 prisoners are available).\n2. Assign each prisoner to a specific digit in the binary representation.\n3. For each test, if the corresponding digit in the bottle's binary representation is 1, the prisoner will drink from that bottle.\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners have been affected by the poison. The pattern of affected and unaffected prisoners will correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle's number.\n\nBy using this strategy, the king can identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours, making option A the correct answer.\n\nReturning the answer in JSON format:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is because the average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. If you walk to your friend's house at 3mph and run back at the same speed, your average speed would still be 3mph. To double this, you would need to run back at 6mph.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Let's say the distance to your friend's house is D miles.\n2. You walk there at 3mph, so the time it takes is D\/3 hours.\n3. To double your average speed for the entire trip, you need the total distance (2D miles) to be covered in half the time it took you to walk there (D\/6 hours).\n4. So, the speed you need to run back at is the distance divided by the time, which is 2D \/ (D\/6) = 12D\/D = 12 miles\/hour for the return trip.\n5. However, this is the speed you would need to maintain for the entire round trip to double your average speed, not just the return trip.\n6.
