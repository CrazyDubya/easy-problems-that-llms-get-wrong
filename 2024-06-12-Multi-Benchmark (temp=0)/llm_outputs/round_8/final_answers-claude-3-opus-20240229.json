Using a binary search strategy, the prisoners can be used to test subsets of the bottles in a way that minimizes the number of tests needed. Specifically, the bottles can be divided into 10 groups of 100 each. Each prisoner samples the wine from a different group. After 24 hours, the prisoners that sampled from the group containing the poisoned bottle will have died. This narrows it down to 100 bottles. Then the process can be repeated, dividing that group of 100 into 10 groups of 10 each. After another round of testing, this will identify the specific group of 10 containing the poison. One final round of testing those 10 bottles individually will definitively identify the single poisoned bottle. So in just 3 rounds of testing leveraging the 10 prisoners, the poisoned bottle can be conclusively determined within the 24 hour time limit.\n\nChoices B and C would require waiting 24 hours after each prisoner samples a subset of the bottles. There is not enough time for multiple iterations of this. \n\nChoice D relies on the prisoners' taste perception, which is subjective and error-prone compared to the definitive binary search approach.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
