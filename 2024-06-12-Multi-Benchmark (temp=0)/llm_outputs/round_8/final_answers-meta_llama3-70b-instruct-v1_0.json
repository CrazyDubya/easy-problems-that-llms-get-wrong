Since the poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption, we can use a binary search strategy to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle of wine with a binary number from 0 to 999 (since there are 1000 bottles).\n2. Divide the prisoners into two groups of 5.\n3. For each group, have them drink a mixture of wine from bottles with a 0 in a specific binary position (e.g., bottles 0-511 for the first group, and bottles 512-999 for the second group).\n4.

When we add a second person, the probability that they have a different birthday than the first person is 364\/365, since there's one fewer day available. The probability that they have the same birthday is therefore 1 - 364\/365 = 1\/365.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where we have n pairs of twins, or 2n people in total. We want to find the smallest value of n such that the probability that at least two people share a birthday is at least 50%.\n\nUsing the complementary probability, we can calculate the probability that all 2n people have different birthdays.
