Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"A\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is A and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:** Identify one poisoned bottle out of 1000 with only 10 test subjects and 24 hours before the poison takes effect.\n\n* **Why A is Correct (Binary Search):**\n\n    1. **Number Representation:** Think of each prisoner as representing a digit in a binary number. With 10 prisoners, you can represent numbers up to 1023 (2^10 - 1).\n\n    2. **Labeling and Wine Mixing:**\n        * Label each bottle with a number from 1 to 1000.\n        * Convert each bottle's number into its binary equivalent.\n        * Each prisoner is assigned a 'digit place' in the binary number (e.g., prisoner 1 is the ones place, prisoner 2 is the twos place, prisoner 3 is the fours place, and so on).\n        *  Prisoners drink from a bottle if their corresponding 'digit place' in the bottle's binary number is a '1'.\n\n    3. **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die. The binary representation of the poisoned bottle's number is formed by noting which prisoners died. For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0011000001, which converts to 801. So, bottle number 801 was poisoned.\n\n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n    * **B:**  Highly inefficient and dangerous. It would require each prisoner to drink from 1000 bottles, leading to likely death for all prisoners.\n    * **C:**  Still inefficient. Each prisoner would need to drink from 100 bottles.\n    * **D:** The question states the poison is only noticeable after 24 hours, making tasting ineffective.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
