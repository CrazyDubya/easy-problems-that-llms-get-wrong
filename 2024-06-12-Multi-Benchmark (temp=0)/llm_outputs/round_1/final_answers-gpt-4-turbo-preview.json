Here's the explanation:\n\nWhen you initially choose a door (let's say door No. 1), there's a 1\/3 chance that the gold bar is behind that door, and a 2\/3 chance that it's behind one of the other two doors (either No. 2 or No. 3).\n\nIf the host, who knows what's behind each door, then asks if you'd like to switch to door No. 2, it's important to understand that the host's action (or question in this case) doesn't change the initial probabilities. The host's question might seem to imply a 50-50 chance now, but it doesn't actually change the fact that there was a 2\/3 chance the gold bar was behind one of the doors you didn't pick initially.\n\nHowever, the question as stated doesn't follow the usual Monty Hall scenario exactly because the host doesn't reveal a door with rotten vegetables behind it before asking if you want to switch. Instead, the host directly asks if you want to switch to door No. 2, without providing additional information.\n\nGiven this, without the host revealing a door first (which is a crucial part of the Monty Hall problem), the question essentially becomes a simple choice between sticking with your initial choice or switching to another door without any additional information. This means each door still has an equal 1\/3 chance of having the gold bar behind it, because no additional information has been provided to alter those odds.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, given the specific way the question is asked, is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```\n\nThis answer assumes the host's question doesn't follow the traditional Monty Hall reveal, which is crucial for the usual strategic advantage of switching doors to apply.","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Originally, there were 6 possible chambers the bullet could have been in, with 5 of them containing bullets. When the trigger was pulled and no bullet was fired, one of the empty possibilities was eliminated, leaving 5 chambers, of which 5 are filled. However, because the trigger was pulled once without a bullet being fired, it means that the chamber that was aligned with the barrel was empty. This leaves 5 possible chambers, 4 of which contain bullets. Therefore, without spinning, the probability of hitting a bullet is 4 out of 5.\n\nComparing the probabilities:\n- Spinning again: 5\/6 chance of hitting a bullet.\n- Not spinning: 4\/5 chance of hitting a bullet.\n\nGiven this, not spinning the chamber gives you a slightly better chance of survival because 4\/5 (or 0.8) is less than 5\/6 (approximately 0.833).\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

The key is to never leave the goat alone with the wolf or the cabbage. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. The farmer takes the goat across the river first, leaving the wolf and the cabbage on the original side. This prevents the goat from being eaten by the wolf or the goat eating the cabbage. (1 crossing)\n2. The farmer returns alone to the original side to get either the wolf or the cabbage. Let's say he takes the wolf next. (2 crossings)\n3. The farmer leaves the wolf on the other side but takes the goat back with him to the original side. This is because leaving the goat with the wolf would result in the goat being eaten.

The key is to ask a question in such a way that it doesn't matter if the guard is the one who lies or the one who tells the truth; the answer will guide you to the door of freedom.\n\nA classic question to ask in this scenario is: \"If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to freedom, what would he say?\" \n\nHere's how it works:\n- If you ask the truthful guard, he will tell you that the lying guard would point to the door that leads to certain death, because the liar would lie about the safe door.\n- If you ask the lying guard, he would also point to the door that leads to certain death because he would lie about what the truthful guard would actually say (the truthful guard would point to the door of freedom).\n\nIn both cases, the guard you ask will indicate the door that leads to certain death. Knowing this, you can then choose the opposite door to find freedom. Therefore, you only need to ask one question to safely determine which door leads to freedom.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

To reach a situation where the probability of at least two people (or in this case, at least two pairs of twins) sharing the same birthday is at least 50%, we would need to double the number of pairs from the original 23 people required in the classic problem.

The question is about doubling the average speed for the entire trip, which includes both walking to the friend's house and running back. \n\nLet's denote:\n- The distance to the friend's house as \\(D\\) miles.\n- The walking speed as 3 mph.\n- The running speed back as \\(R\\) mph.\n\nThe time to walk to the friend's house is \\(D \/ 3\\) hours. The time to run back is \\(D \/ R\\) hours.\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance for the round trip is \\(2D\\) miles. The total time is \\(D \/ 3 + D \/ R\\) hours.\n\nThe question states that the average speed for the entire trip should be double the walking speed, which is \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) mph.\n\nSo, we have:\n\\[ \\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} = \\frac{2D}{D\/3 + D\/R} = 6 \\, \\text{mph} \\]\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{2D}{D\/3 + D\/R} \\]\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{2}{1\/3 + 1\/R} \\]\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{2}{(R + 3) \/ 3R} \\]\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{6R}{R + 3} \\]\n\\[ 6R + 18 = 6R \\]\n\nHowever, this simplification step was to illustrate the process, and it seems we've gone astray in trying to directly solve for \\(R\\) this way. Let's correct the approach focusing on the concept that the average speed for the entire trip is determined by the total distance and total time.\n\nGiven the correct approach:\n\\[ \\text{Average speed for the entire trip} = 6 \\, \\text{mph} \\]\n\nWe need to find \\(R\\) such that when you walk at 3 mph to a place and run back at \\(R\\) mph, your average speed is 6 mph.\n\nThe correct way to approach this is to realize that to double the average speed of the entire trip to 6 mph, considering the distances are equal, the time spent on each part of the trip needs to be the same because speed is inversely proportional to time when distance is constant. However, to actually double the average speed, you would need to make the return trip instantaneously, which is impossible. The confusion in the simplification above shows the complexity of directly solving for \\(R\\) without considering the fundamental relationship between speed, distance, and time.\n\nGiven the impossibility of achieving an average speed of 6 mph by any finite running speed after walking at 3 mph for half the trip, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```\n\nThis is because to double the average speed for the entire trip to 6 mph, after walking at 3 mph for half the distance, you would theoretically need to travel the return half instantaneously, implying an infinite speed.","score":""}}
