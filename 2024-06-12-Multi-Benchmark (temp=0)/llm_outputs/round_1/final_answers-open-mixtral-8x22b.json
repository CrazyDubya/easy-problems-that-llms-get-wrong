Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from one bottle in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoner, if any, was affected by the poison.\n4. If a prisoner was affected, the poisoned bottle is in their group of 100.
