The slowest person across the bridge limits the speed of the whole group. Therefore, the group's speed is determined by Person D's speed of 10 minutes. However, we do not know the order in which the individuals cross the bridge. If the torch is handed off between each individual, then the torch-bearer would have to wait for each person to finish before crossing. This would result in a time of 12 minutes (10 minutes for Person D, plus one minute for each of the other three people). Alternatively, if Person A starts, followed by B, then C, and finally D, and each person takes the torch with them, the group could potentially cross in 11 minutes (using the fastest time of each individual). The fastest scenario occurs if the people pair up: A & B, then C & D. The first pair hands the torch to the second pair waiting on the other side, and the torch is not needed during the exchange. This reduces the overall time by a minute. Therefore, the fastest time they can all get across the bridge is 12 minutes, although special circumstances could reduce this time to 11 minutes.","score":""},"15":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You're in a room with two doors that lead out.

Binary search is an efficient method to find an item from a large group of items, and it can be explained by the concept of binary numbers. Here's how it can be applied in this scenario:\n\nDay 1: Give each prisoner a different pair of bottles, that is, 1\u20132, 3\u20134, 5\u20136, and so on. This will result in 5 pairs being given to each prisoner.\n\nDay 2: Check which prisoners got sick. Since the poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption, the king will know which pairs contain the poisoned wine.\n\nDay 3: Now that the king knows which pairs are poisoned, he can give new pairs to the prisoners, this time excluding the previously chosen ones. For example, if prisoner 1 was sick after drinking pair 1\u20132, then the next pair given to him could be 7\u20138. This step significantly reduces the search space in half.\n\nThis process is repeated until only one bottle remains, which must be the poisoned one.
