Since there are 10 prisoners, we can use a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each prisoner with a unique binary number from 0 to 9 (e.g., 0000, 0001, 0010, ..., 1001).\n2. Assign each bottle of wine a unique binary number from 0 to 999 (since there are 1000 bottles).\n3. For each prisoner, have them drink from the bottles that correspond to a 1 in their binary label. For example, prisoner 0001 would drink from bottles 1, 1001, 2001, ..., 9001.\n4. Wait 24 hours and observe which prisoners die.\n5. Use the binary labels of the dead prisoners to determine which bottle is poisoned.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 0001, 0101, and 1101 die, we know that the poisoned bottle is 1101 (since it's the only bottle that all three prisoners drank from).\n\nThis strategy ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing, using all 10 prisoners.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is a classic problem known as the \"birthday problem.\"\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n\nFor a single pair of twins, the probability that they share a birthday is 1, since they're twins.\n\nFor two pairs of twins, the probability that at least one pair shares a birthday is still 1, since each pair is guaranteed to share a birthday.\n\nHowever, as we add more pairs of twins, the probability that at least two people share a birthday starts to increase. We can calculate this probability using the complementary probability, i.e., the probability that no two people share a birthday.\n\nFor 23 pairs of twins (46 people), the probability that no two people share a birthday is:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-45)\/365) \u2248 0.493\n\nThis means that the probability that at least two people share a birthday is approximately 1 - 0.493 = 0.507, which is greater than 50%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

This means that there are always more rooms available, no matter how many guests are currently staying at the hotel.\n\nAt first glance, it might seem like option D, \"By putting the guest in an empty room,\" would be the obvious answer. However, this option doesn't take into account the fact that the hotel is already partially full. If we simply put the new guest in an empty room, we wouldn't be making any use of the existing guests or rooms.\n\nThe correct answer is actually option C, \"You ask each current guest to move to the room number n*2.\" This solution works because it allows us to free up room 1 (which is currently occupied) and move the new guest into it. By asking each current guest to move to the room number n*2, we are effectively shifting all the guests over by one room, making room 1 available for the new guest.\n\nFor example, if the hotel currently has guests in rooms 1, 2, 3, ..., we would ask the guest in room 1 to move to room 2, the guest in room 2 to move to room 4, the guest in room 3 to move to room 6, and so on.
