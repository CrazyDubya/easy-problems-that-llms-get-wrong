This action does not change the initial probabilities but provides additional information.\n\n3. **Switching vs. Staying**:\n   - If you **stay** with your initial choice (Door No. 1), the probability of winning the gold bar remains 1\/3.\n   - If you **switch** to the other unopened door (in this case, Door No. 2), the probability of winning the gold bar is 2\/3. This is because the host's action of revealing a rotten vegetable behind one of the other doors effectively transfers the 2\/3 probability to the remaining unopened door.\n\nGiven this analysis, switching doors gives you a higher probability of winning the gold bar.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to switch to Door No. 2.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"A\"\n}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This means there is one empty chamber. When your opponent spins the chambers and fires, he lands on the empty chamber, leaving five chambers, all of which are loaded with bullets.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, you know that the next chamber in sequence is one of the five loaded chambers.

The key insight here is to use a binary representation to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0000000000 (for bottle 1) to 1111101000 (for bottle 1000). This is because 1000 bottles can be represented by 10 bits (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000).\n\n2. **Assigning Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners can be assigned to a specific bit position in the binary representation of the bottle numbers. For example, Prisoner 1 could be responsible for the least significant bit, Prisoner 2 for the next bit, and so on up to Prisoner 10 for the most significant bit.\n\n3. **Testing Strategy**: Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1. For instance, if a bottle's binary representation is 0101010101, then Prisoners 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 will drink from that bottle.\n\n4. **Interpreting Results**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, using the information from the 10 prisoners efficiently.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
