Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy. This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Each prisoner can be thought of as a bit in a binary number, and each bottle can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number. By giving each prisoner a sip from the bottles that correspond to a '1' in the binary representation of the bottle number, the king can identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing.\n\nFor example, if the poisoned bottle is number 589 (1011001001 in binary), the king would give a sip from bottles 1, 8, 9, 512, and 256 to the corresponding prisoners. If prisoners 1, 8, and 512 die, the king would know that the poisoned bottle is number 589 (since 1+8+512=521, and 521-32=589).\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just 24 hours, making it the fastest way to find the poisoned bottle.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
