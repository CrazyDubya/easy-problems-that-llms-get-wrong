Since the distance to your friend's house is the same in both directions, we can use the harmonic mean formula for average speed:\n\nAverage speed = 2 * (speed1 * speed2) \/ (speed1 + speed2)\n\nIn this case, speed1 is 3mph (walking to your friend's house), and speed2 is x mph (running back). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nAverage speed = 2 * (3 * x) \/ (3 + x)\n\nWe want the average speed for the entire trip to be double the walking speed, which is 6mph. So we can set up the equation:\n\n6 = 2 * (3 * x) \/ (3 + x)\n\nNow, let's solve for x:\n\n6 * (3 + x) = 2 * (3 * x)\n18 + 6x = 6x\n18 = 6x - 6x\n18 = 0\n\nThis equation has no solution, which means that it's not possible to double the average speed for the entire trip by running back at any finite speed.
