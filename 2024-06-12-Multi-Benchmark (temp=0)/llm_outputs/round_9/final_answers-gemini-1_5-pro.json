For example:\n    * Bottle 5 (binary 0000000101): Prisoners 1 and 3 would sip.\n    * Bottle 500 (binary 0111110100): Prisoners 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 would sip.\n4. **Observe After 24 Hours:**  Note which prisoners die. The dead prisoners represent '1's in the binary code of the poisoned bottle, and the living prisoners represent '0's. \n5. **Decode the Result:** Combine the '1's and '0's based on the prisoners' fates to form the binary code of the poisoned bottle. Convert this binary code back to decimal to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\n**This method allows you to test a large number of possibilities with a small number of 'tests' (prisoners) by leveraging the power of binary representation.**\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
