The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, offers you the chance to switch to Door No. 2. Importantly, the host's offer implies that Door No. 2 is not the door with the rotten vegetables (if it were, the host would not offer it).\n\n3. **Switching vs. Staying**:\n   - If you **stay** with Door No. 1, your probability of winning the gold bar remains 1\/3.\n   - If you **switch** to Door No. 2, your probability of winning the gold bar increases to 2\/3. This is because the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge of what is behind the doors, effectively eliminating one of the losing options.\n\nTherefore, switching to Door No. 2 gives you a higher probability of winning the gold bar.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best choice is to switch to Door No. 2.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Given that we have 10 prisoners and 1000 bottles, we can use a binary representation strategy to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0000000000 (0 in decimal) to 1111101000 (999 in decimal). This gives us a 10-bit binary number for each bottle.\n\n2. **Assigning Tests**: Each prisoner will represent a bit in the binary number. For example, prisoner 1 will represent the least significant bit (2^0), prisoner 2 will represent the next bit (2^1), and so on up to prisoner 10 who will represent the most significant bit (2^9).\n\n3. **Testing Strategy**: Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1. For instance, prisoner 1 will drink from all bottles where the least significant bit is 1 (i.e., bottles 1, 3, 5, 7, etc.), prisoner 2 will drink from bottles where the second bit is 1 (i.e., bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, etc.), and so on.\n\n4. **Identifying the Poisoned Bottle**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with a maximum of 10 tests, leveraging the binary representation of numbers.\n\nGiven the options, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"To determine how fast you would need to run back to double your average speed for the entire trip, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the distance to your friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_1 \\) be the time it takes to walk to your friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_2 \\) be the time it takes to run back.\n\n2. **Calculate Time to Walk to Friend's House:**\n   - You walk to your friend's house at 3 mph.\n   - Time to walk to your friend's house, \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n\n3. **Total Distance and Desired Average Speed:**\n   - The total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\).\n   - The desired average speed for the entire trip is double the walking speed, so \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) mph.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Time for Desired Average Speed:**\n   - The total time for the round trip to achieve an average speed of 6 mph is \\( \\frac{2d}{6} = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n\n5. **Determine Time to Run Back:**\n   - The total time for the trip is the sum of the time to walk to the friend's house and the time to run back: \\( t_1 + t_2 \\).\n   - We know \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n   - We need \\( t_1 + t_2 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n\n6. **Solve for \\( t_2 \\):**\n   - \\( \\frac{d}{3} + t_2 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n   - This implies \\( t_2 = 0 \\).\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - To achieve the desired average speed of 6 mph for the entire trip, you would need to run back in zero time, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that you would need to run back infinitely fast.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"A\"\n}\n```","score":""}}
