This strategy allows him to test multiple bottles at once and eliminate large groups of bottles in a single test. By leveraging the concept of binary numbers, the king can assign each prisoner a unique binary number and give them a combination of wines to drink based on their binary number. If a prisoner dies, the king can use their binary number to determine which bottle was poisoned.\n\nFor example, if the king assigns the prisoners binary numbers from 000 to 1001 (in binary) and gives them the corresponding wine bottles to drink, he can identify the poisoned bottle in just one day. If prisoner number 010 dies, the king knows that the third bottle (counting from the right) is poisoned.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

However, in this case, we're dealing with pairs of twins.\n\nIn the context of this question, I'll assume that the twins are not identical, meaning they can have different birthdays. This assumption makes the problem equivalent to the classic birthday problem, as each twin is considered an individual.\n\nThe classic birthday problem is a counter-intuitive probability problem. The probability that at least two people share a birthday becomes greater than 50% when there are 23 people in a room. This is because the probability of 23 people all having different birthdays is less than 50%.\n\nSo, in the context of this question, we would need 23 individual people. Since each pair of twins counts as two individuals, we would need 23\/2 = 11.5 pairs of twins.
