This strategy allows him to test multiple bottles at once and eliminate large groups of bottles in a single test. By leveraging the concept of binary numbers, the king can assign each prisoner a unique binary number and give them a combination of wines to drink based on their binary number. If a prisoner dies, the king can use their binary number to determine which bottle was poisoned.\n\nFor example, if the king assigns the prisoners binary numbers from 000 to 1001 (in binary) and gives them the corresponding wine bottles to drink, he can identify the poisoned bottle in just one day. If prisoner number 010 dies, the king knows that the third bottle (counting from the right) is poisoned.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

However, in this case, we're dealing with pairs of twins.\n\nIn the context of this question, I'll assume that the twins are not identical, meaning they can have different birthdays. This assumption makes the problem equivalent to the classic birthday problem, as we're still looking for unique individuals.\n\nThe classic birthday problem is a counter-intuitive problem in probability theory. The solution involves calculating the probability that each person added to the room does not share a birthday with anyone already in the room, and then subtracting that probability from 1 to find the probability that at least two people do share a birthday.\n\nFor a 50% chance (0.5 probability), you need 23 people. Since we're considering pairs of twins, and each pair adds 2 people to the room, we would need:\n\n23 people \/ 2 people per pair = 11.5 pairs\n\nSince we can't have half a pair, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 12 pairs.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
