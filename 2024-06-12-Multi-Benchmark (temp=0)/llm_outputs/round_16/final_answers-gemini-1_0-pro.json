In this case, the host knows this and offers you the other door (Door No. 2) with the rotten vegetables.

We can determine the connections by observing the bulbs in the same room.\n* **Option B is risky and potentially inaccurate.** Turning on two switches simultaneously might damage the electrical system. Additionally, relying on touch to differentiate between warm and cold LED bulbs is unreliable, as they may not generate enough heat to be noticeable.\n* **Option C is inefficient.** Turning on all switches at once illuminates all bulbs, making it impossible to identify the individual switch-bulb connections.\n* **Option D is the most efficient and accurate approach.** By turning on each switch individually, we can observe which bulb lights up, establishing a direct connection between the switch and the bulb.
