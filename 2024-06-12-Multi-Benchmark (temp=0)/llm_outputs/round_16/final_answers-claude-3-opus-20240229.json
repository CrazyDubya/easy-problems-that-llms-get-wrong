This would not work because the poison takes 24 hours to take effect, so the prisoners would not be able to immediately identify the poisoned wine by taste.\n\nB. This is the best approach. By assigning each bottle a unique 10-digit binary number and having each prisoner sample the bottles corresponding to their assigned digit (1 or 0), the poisoned bottle can be identified within 24 hours using the least number of tests. For example, if prisoners 2, 5, and 8 die, the poisoned bottle's binary number would be 0101000100.\n\nC. While this would eventually identify the poisoned bottle, it would require all 1000 bottles to be tested, killing all 10 prisoners. There are much more efficient ways to find the poisoned bottle.\n\nD. This has the same issue as C - it would require testing all 1000 bottles and would kill multiple prisoners unnecessarily. The binary search method is far more efficient.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B - using a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed and identify the poisoned bottle within the 24 hour time limit.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Each pair of twins shares the same birthday.\n2. We need to find the number of pairs such that the probability of no two people sharing the same birthday is less than 50%.\n3. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be calculated using the formula: (365 \u00d7 364 \u00d7 363 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 (365 - n + 1)) \/ 365^n, where n is the number of people in the room.\n4. Since we are dealing with pairs of twins, the number of people in the room is twice the number of pairs.\n\nLet's try the given options:\n\nA. 12 pairs (24 people): The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday is approximately 0.0072, which is much less than 50%. This means that with 12 pairs of twins, there is a high probability (over 99%) that two people will have the same birthday.\n\nB. 46 pairs (92 people): The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday is extremely close to 0, meaning that with 46 pairs of twins, it is almost certain that two people will have the same birthday.\n\nC. 1 pair (2 people): With just one pair of twins, the probability of them sharing the same birthday is 100%.\n\nD. 23 pairs (46 people): The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday is approximately 0.0046, which is much less than 50%.
