Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n\nThere are 366 possible birthdays, considering leap years, and 365 non-leap years. To find the probability of two people in a room having the same birthday, we use the formula for combinations: C(n, r) = r! \/ (r\u2212k)!n! where r is the number of possible outcomes and k is the number of choices. \n\nWith 365 possible birthdays, the probability of two specific people having the same birthday is: C(365, 2) = 1\/730\n\nFor this probability to be greater than 1\/2, we must have more than one pair of people with the same birthday. Using the same formula, the probability of three people having the same birthday is C(365, 3) = 1\/1460. \n\nTo solve, we must find the minimum number of pairs needed for a 50% likelihood that three people in the room share a birthday. Using the complementary event, we get:\n\n1 - C(365, 3) < 1\/2\nC(365, 3) > 1\/2\n2 * C(365, 3) > 1\n\nThe probability of four people having the same birthday is C(365, 4) = 1\/2551. Adding this to our previous probability, we get:\n\n1\/1460 + 1\/2551 > 1\/2\n\nTherefore the minimum number of pairs required is 2, hence the answer is **B**.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
