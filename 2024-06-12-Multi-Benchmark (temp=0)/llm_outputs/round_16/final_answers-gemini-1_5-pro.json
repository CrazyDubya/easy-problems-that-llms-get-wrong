The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the correct answer is **B** and the reasoning behind it:\n\n* **A is incorrect** because if multiple prisoners taste from the poisoned bottle, they'll all die, making it impossible to pinpoint the exact bottle.\n* **C is incorrect** for the same reason as A \u2013 it leads to the death of all prisoners, making the identification impossible.\n* **D is incorrect** because it still risks the lives of all prisoners. \n\n**B is the most efficient and humane solution:**\n\n**Binary Search Strategy:**\n\n1. **Numbering:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.  Number the bottles using binary from 0000000001 to 1111101000 (which represents 1000 in decimal).\n2. **Tasting:** Each digit in the binary number represents a prisoner and a corresponding bottle. For example:\n    * Bottle 1 (0000000001): Only Prisoner 1 drinks.\n    * Bottle 2 (0000000010): Only Prisoner 2 drinks.\n    * Bottle 3 (0000000011): Both Prisoner 1 and Prisoner 2 drink. \n3. **Observation:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died. Construct a binary number where '1' represents a dead prisoner and '0' a living one. This binary number directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle number.\n\n**Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0001001001, which translates to bottle number 521.\n\n**Why this works:** Binary search is highly efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles simultaneously. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
