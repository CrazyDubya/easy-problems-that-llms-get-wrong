The trick involves asking a question that forces both guardians to give the same answer, regardless of their nature (truth-teller or liar).\n\nThe question to ask either guardian is: \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would they point to?\"\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n- If you ask the truth-telling guardian, they will truthfully tell you that the lying guardian would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the lying guardian, they will lie about the truth-telling guardian's answer, and thus also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the answer you get will point to the death door.

Given that the poison takes exactly 24 hours to take effect, we can use a binary representation strategy to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is more than 1000). Each bit in the binary number can correspond to whether a specific prisoner drinks from that bottle or not.\n\n2. **Assigning Bottles to Prisoners**: Assign each bottle a number from 0 to 999. Convert each number to its 10-bit binary equivalent. Each bit in the binary number will determine whether a specific prisoner drinks from that bottle. For example, if the binary representation of a bottle number is `1010101010`, then prisoners 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 will drink from that bottle.\n\n3. **Observation**: After 24 hours, observe which prisoners are dead. The combination of dead prisoners will form a binary number, which corresponds to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, using the binary representation of the bottle numbers and the 10 prisoners.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Therefore, he must jump at least slightly higher than the height of the hurdle to ensure he clears it.\n\nGiven the options:\n- A. 0.5m: This would be the height of the hurdle itself, but to clear it, he needs to jump slightly higher.\n- B. Between 0.1m and 0.5m: This range is below the height of the hurdle, so it is not sufficient to clear it.\n- C. 0m: This means no jump at all, which is not possible to clear a 0.5m hurdle.\n- D. Slightly higher than 0.5m: This is the correct choice because to clear a 0.5m hurdle, the man must jump slightly higher than 0.5m.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"30":{"category":"Popular science","question":"I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.
