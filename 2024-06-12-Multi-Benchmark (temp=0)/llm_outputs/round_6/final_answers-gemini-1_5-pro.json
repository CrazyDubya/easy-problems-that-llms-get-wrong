Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.**  This strategy only works if you have as many prisoners as bottles. With 10 prisoners, you can only test 10 bottles at a time.\\n\\n* **B. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.** This is incredibly inefficient and dangerous. It also doesn't guarantee you'll find the poisoned bottle.\\n\\n* **C. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours** This is the most efficient method. Here's how it works:\\n    1. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\\n    2. **Number the Bottles:**  Imagine each bottle has a binary number assigned (1-1000 in binary is 0000000001 to 1111101000).\\n    3. **Assign Wine Based on Binary:** On day one, each prisoner drinks from bottles where their corresponding binary digit is a '1'. For example, prisoner #1 drinks from bottle #1 (0000000001), bottle #3 (0000000011), bottle #5 (0000000101), and so on. Prisoner #2 drinks from bottle #2 (0000000010), bottle #3 (0000000011), bottle #6 (0000000110), and so on.\\n    4. **Observe After 24 Hours:** The prisoners who die represent '1' bits in the poisoned bottle's binary number. The prisoners who live represent '0' bits. Construct the binary number, convert to decimal, and you have the poisoned bottle number.\\n\\n* **D. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.**  The problem states the poison is tasteless, only taking effect after 24 hours.\\n\\n**Binary Search Efficiency:** With 10 prisoners, you can represent binary numbers up to 1023 (2^10 - 1), allowing you to test far more than 10 bottles at a time. \"\n}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
