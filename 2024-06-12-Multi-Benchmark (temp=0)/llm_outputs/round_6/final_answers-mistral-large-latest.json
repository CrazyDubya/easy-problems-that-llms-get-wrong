When your opponent fires and no bullet comes out, it means that the chamber was empty. If you don't spin the revolver, you know that the next chamber has a bullet in it, because the revolver moves one chamber further each time the trigger is pulled. Therefore, if you don't spin, you will fire a bullet with certainty.\n\nOn the other hand, if you do spin the revolver, there's a chance that the empty chamber could end up in the firing position again. The probability of this happening is 1 out of 6, because there are 6 chambers in total and only 1 is empty.

This strategy allows him to test multiple bottles at once, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000 (which requires 10 digits, as 2^10 = 1024).\n2. Assign each digit position to a different prisoner.\n3. If the digit in a prisoner's position is 1, have them drink from the bottle.\n4. After 24 hours, check which prisoners have died. The combination of their positions will give the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 8 die, the poisoned bottle would be labeled with the binary number 1000 (which is 8 in decimal), as the first, fourth, and eighth digits are 1.\n\nThis method allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing, with results available in 24 hours.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
