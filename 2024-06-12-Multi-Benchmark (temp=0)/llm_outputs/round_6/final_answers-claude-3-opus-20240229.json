The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nC. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nD.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"Here is my analysis:\n\nThe key to solving this efficiently is to use the minimum number of tests needed to uniquely identify the poisoned bottle out of 1000 bottles. A binary search strategy is optimal.\n\nWith 10 prisoners, you can represent 1024 (2^10) different states using a 10-digit binary number, where each digit represents whether a particular prisoner drank from a given subset of bottles (1 means yes, 0 means no). \n\nFor example:\n- Prisoner 1 drinks from bottles 1,3,5,7... (every other bottle)\n- Prisoner 2 drinks from bottles 2-3, 6-7, 10-11... (alternating pairs) \n- Prisoner 3 drinks from bottles 4-7, 12-15... (alternating groups of 4)\n- And so on, with each prisoner drinking from alternating groups of size 2^(n-1)\n\nAfter 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who died will directly map to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle number. For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 7 died, that means bottle number 0101000100 = 324 was poisoned.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n\nUsing this binary search strategy with 10 prisoners is the most efficient approach, requiring only 1 round of testing to identify the poisoned bottle out of 1000 total bottles.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
