It depends on two factors:\n\n1. **Mass:** The amount of matter in an object.\n2. **Gravity:** The force of attraction between objects with mass.\n\nOn Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.8 m\/s\u00b2. This means that every kilogram of mass experiences a force of 9.8 Newtons.\n\n## Analyzing the Options:\n\n* **A pound of water:** Water has a density of 1 kg\/L. This means that one pound of water (approximately 0.45 kg) has a mass of 0.45 kg. \n* **Two pounds of bricks:** Bricks have a higher density than water, typically around 2 kg\/L. Two pounds of bricks (approximately 0.9 kg) have a mass of 0.9 kg.\n* **A pound of feathers:** Feathers have a much lower density than water, typically around 0.05 kg\/L. A pound of feathers (approximately 0.45 kg) has a mass of 0.45 kg.\n* **Three pounds of air:** Air is a mixture of gases with a very low density, approximately 1.2 kg\/m\u00b3. Three pounds of air (approximately 1.36 kg) has a mass of 1.36 kg.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nComparing the masses, we can see that:\n\n* A pound of water and a pound of feathers have the same mass (0.45 kg).\n* Two pounds of bricks have a mass of 0.9 kg, which is double the mass of a pound of water or feathers.\n* Three pounds of air have the highest mass (1.36 kg) among all options.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n**C.

For example, we could ask: \"Is the sky blue?\" The truthful guardian will answer \"yes,\" while the liar will answer \"no.\"\n\n2. **Follow the opposite of the liar's answer:** Once we know which guardian is the liar, we can ask them a question about the doors. For instance, we could ask the liar: \"Which door leads to freedom?\" Since the liar always lies, their answer will be the opposite of the actual door leading to freedom. Therefore, if the liar says the left door leads to freedom, we know the right door is the safe one.\n\nTherefore, with just one question, we can identify the liar and subsequently determine the door to freedom.\n\nHere's the JSON format response:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n``` \n","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.
