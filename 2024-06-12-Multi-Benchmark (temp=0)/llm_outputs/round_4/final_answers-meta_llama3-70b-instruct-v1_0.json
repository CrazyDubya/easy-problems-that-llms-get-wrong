Since the bulbs are LED and don't get warm when turned on, we can't use temperature to determine which switch controls which bulb.\n\nThe best approach is to turn each switch on one at a time and observe the bulbs.

If one of the bulbs turns on, we know switch A controls that bulb.\n2. Turn switch A off and turn switch B on. If a different bulb turns on, we know switch B controls that bulb. If the same bulb turns on, we know switch B also controls that bulb (but we'll get to that in a minute).\n3. Turn switch B off and turn switch C on. If a different bulb turns on, we know switch C controls that bulb. If the same bulb turns on, we know switch C also controls that bulb.\n4.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"Here's my explanation and answer:\n\nThe key to this problem is to use the 10 prisoners efficiently to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours. Option A is not possible because the poison takes effect after 24 hours, so the prisoners won't be able to taste the bitterness. Option D is also not feasible because it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is impractical and would likely take more than 24 hours.\n\nOption B is a possible approach, but it's not the most efficient. If we divide the 1000 bottles among the 10 prisoners, each prisoner would need to sample around 100 bottles. This would require a large number of tests, and we might not be able to identify the poisoned bottle in 24 hours.\n\nThe most efficient approach is Option C, which uses a binary search strategy. We can assign each prisoner a unique binary number from 0 to 9 (e.g., 0000000000 to 1000000000). Then, we can have each prisoner sample a subset of bottles corresponding to their binary number. For example, prisoner 0 would sample bottles 1, 3, 5, ..., 999 (i.e., bottles where the least significant bit is 0), while prisoner 1 would sample bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, ... (i.e., bottles where the second least significant bit is 0).\n\nAfter 24 hours, we can analyze the results to identify the poisoned bottle. If a prisoner dies, we know that the poisoned bottle is among the ones they sampled. By combining the results from all prisoners, we can narrow down the possibilities to a single bottle. This approach requires a maximum of 10 tests and can identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

We want to find the smallest n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%.\n\nWe can approach this problem by calculating the probability that no two people share a birthday, and then subtracting that from 1 to get the probability that at least two people share a birthday.\n\nThe probability that the first person has a unique birthday is 365\/365 (since there are 365 possible birthdays). The probability that the second person has a unique birthday (different from the first person) is 364\/365. The probability that the third person has a unique birthday (different from the first two) is 363\/365, and so on.\n\nFor 2n people, the probability that all of them have unique birthdays is:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-2n+1)\/365)\n\nWe want to find the smallest n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%, which means the probability of all of them having unique birthdays is at most 50%.
