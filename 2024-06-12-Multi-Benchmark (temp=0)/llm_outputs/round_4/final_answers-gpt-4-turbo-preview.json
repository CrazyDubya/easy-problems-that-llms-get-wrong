You initially choose one door out of three, which means you have a 1\/3 chance of picking the door with the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance of picking a door with rotten vegetables.\n2. The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens another door, not chosen by you, to reveal rotten vegetables.

There's no need to walk into another room to observe the bulbs as stated in option B because the question specifies that the light bulbs are in the same room as the switches. Option D would not allow you to determine which switch controls which bulb since all the bulbs would be on at the same time. Therefore, the best way to determine which switch turns on which light bulb is by turning each switch on one at a time and observing the bulbs, as stated in option C. This method allows you to directly correlate each switch with its corresponding bulb by process of elimination and direct observation.","score":""},"17":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"The Poisoned Wine - A king has 1000 sweet bottles of wine, and one contains a very bitter poison.

This method involves labeling each bottle with a unique number from 1 to 1000 and then converting those numbers into binary. Since there are 10 prisoners, you can use them to represent the 10 binary digits (bits) needed to cover numbers up to 1024 (2^10 = 1024, which is more than enough for 1000 bottles).\n\nEach prisoner will drink from bottles that have a '1' in the position of their corresponding bit. For example, if a bottle's binary number has a '1' in the bit position that represents prisoner 1, that prisoner will drink from it. This process is repeated for all prisoners across all bottles. After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will directly correspond to the binary number of the poisoned bottle. This method ensures that the king only needs to wait 24 hours to identify the poisoned bottle, making it the fastest and most efficient strategy given the constraints. Choices A, B, and D do not utilize the prisoners in a way that minimizes the number of tests needed or the time to identify the poisoned bottle.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"To solve this problem, let's first understand what is being asked. The question is about doubling the average speed for the entire trip, which includes both walking to the friend's house and running back. \n\nLet's denote:\n- The distance to the friend's house as \\(D\\) miles.\n- The walking speed as 3 mph.\n- The running speed back as \\(R\\) mph.\n\nThe time to walk to the friend's house is \\(D \/ 3\\) hours.\n\nIf we want to double the average speed of the entire trip, we first need to calculate the average speed for the trip without knowing the running speed. The average speed for a round trip is the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance for the round trip is \\(2D\\) miles.\n\nTo double the average speed of the entire trip, the total time for the trip should be halved, because speed is inversely proportional to time when distance is constant.\n\nThe time taken to walk to the friend's house is \\(D \/ 3\\) hours. To double the average speed, the total time for both going and coming back should be \\(D \/ 3\\) hours, which means the time to run back should also be \\(D \/ 3\\) hours. But we want to double the average speed for the entire trip, not just match the walking speed, so this approach needs adjustment.\n\nThe correct approach is to calculate the required speed to make the average speed for the entire trip double the initial average speed with the correct understanding of the relationship between speed, distance, and time.\n\nGiven:\n- Average speed to be doubled = \\(3\\) mph (since walking speed is the initial average speed for half the trip).\n\nFor the average speed to be doubled to \\(6\\) mph over the entire trip, the total time taken for the trip must fit the equation for average speed, which is total distance divided by total time.\n\nHowever, the trick here lies in understanding that doubling the average speed of the entire trip is not as straightforward as doubling the speed of one leg of the trip due to the way average speeds are calculated. The average speed is not simply the arithmetic mean of two speeds when the distances traveled at each speed are the same.\n\nLet's break it down:\n- Time to walk to friend's house at 3 mph for distance \\(D\\): \\(T_1 = D\/3\\).\n- Time to run back at \\(R\\) mph for distance \\(D\\): \\(T_2 = D\/R\\).\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is the total distance (\\(2D\\)) divided by the total time (\\(T_1 + T_2\\)).\n\nTo double the average speed of the entire trip to \\(6\\) mph, we need to consider that the calculation of average speed over a round trip doesn't linearly depend on the speeds of the individual trips but on the total time taken for a given total distance.\n\nThe correct answer is actually derived from understanding that to double the average speed of the entire trip, considering the constraints of time and how average speed is calculated over a distance, is not achievable by simply running back at a fixed higher speed due to the non-linear relationship between speed, distance, and time in this context. The question essentially poses a scenario that misleads by suggesting a simple doubling of speed could achieve the desired outcome.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, given the impossibility of achieving the desired average speed by any finite running speed, is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""}}
