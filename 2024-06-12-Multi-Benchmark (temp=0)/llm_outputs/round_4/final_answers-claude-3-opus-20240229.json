Assign each bottle a unique 10-digit binary number, where each digit represents a prisoner. A 1 means the prisoner drinks from that bottle, a 0 means they don't. Have each prisoner sip from the bottles corresponding to a 1 in their assigned position. After 24 hours, line up the prisoners in their assigned order. The poisoned bottle's number will correspond to the binary number represented by the dead\/alive status of the prisoners.\",\n  \"ANSWER\": \"C\"\n}\n\nThe key insight is to use the prisoners themselves to represent a 10-digit binary number. This allows testing up to 2^10 = 1024 bottles with just 10 prisoners, covering all 1000 bottles. The prisoners' death\/survival maps directly to the binary number of the poisoned bottle.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
