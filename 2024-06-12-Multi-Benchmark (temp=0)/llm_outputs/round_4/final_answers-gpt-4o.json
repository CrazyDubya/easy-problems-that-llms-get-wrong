Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: There are three doors: one with a gold bar and two with rotten vegetables. You initially pick Door No. 1.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, offers you the chance to switch to Door No. 2. Importantly, the host's offer implies that Door No. 2 is not the door you initially picked and is not the door with the gold bar (if the host is following the classic Monty Hall problem rules).\n\n3. **Probabilities**:\n   - When you initially pick Door No. 1, the probability of the gold bar being behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3.\n   - The probability of the gold bar being behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n4. **Host's Knowledge**: The host knows where the gold bar is and will always offer you a door that does not have the gold bar. Therefore, if the gold bar is behind Door No. 2 or Door No. 3, the host will always offer you the other door that does not have the gold bar.\n\n5. **Switching Strategy**: If you switch to Door No. 2, you are effectively betting that your initial choice (Door No. 1) was wrong, which has a probability of 2\/3. If you stay with Door No. 1, you are betting that your initial choice was correct, which has a probability of 1\/3.\n\nTherefore, switching doors gives you a higher probability of winning the gold bar (2\/3) compared to staying with your initial choice (1\/3).\n\nGiven the options, the best choice is to switch to Door No. 2.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"ANSWER\": \"B\"\n}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

The key insight here is to use a binary representation to leverage the 10 prisoners effectively.\n\nEach of the 1000 bottles can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is more than 1000). We can assign each bottle a binary number from 0000000000 to 1111100111 (which corresponds to 0 to 999 in decimal).\n\nHere's how the strategy works:\n1. Assign each bottle a unique 10-bit binary number.\n2. Each prisoner will be responsible for one bit position in the binary number.\n3. If a bottle has a '1' in a specific bit position, the corresponding prisoner will drink from that bottle.\n4. After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number that directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if the poisoned bottle is number 13 (which is 0000001101 in binary), prisoners 1, 3, and 4 (counting from the right, starting at 0) will drink from it. If these prisoners die, the binary number 0000001101 can be decoded to identify bottle 13 as the poisoned one.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, using the binary representation of the bottle numbers and the 10 prisoners.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, where the number of possible pairs grows rapidly with the number of people.\n\nIn this problem, we are dealing with pairs of twins. Each pair of twins shares the same birthday, so we can think of each pair as a single entity when considering the probability of shared birthdays.\n\nIf we have \\( n \\) pairs of twins, we effectively have \\( 2n \\) individuals. To find the number of pairs of twins needed to have at least a 50% chance that two people (from different pairs) share the same birthday, we need to find \\( n \\) such that \\( 2n \\) individuals have a greater than 50% chance of sharing a birthday.\n\nFrom the birthday paradox, we know that 23 individuals are needed for a 50% chance. Therefore, we need \\( 2n \\geq 23 \\).\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\\[ 2n \\geq 23 \\]\n\\[ n \\geq 11.5 \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:\n\\[ n = 12 \\]\n\nThus, we need 12 pairs of twins to have at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

The man must clear the hurdle, which means his jump must be at least as high as the hurdle. However, in practical terms, he would need to jump slightly higher than the hurdle to ensure he clears it without touching it.\n\nGiven the options:\n- A. 0m: This is not possible because he needs to jump to clear the hurdle.\n- B. Between 0.1m and 0.5m: This range does not include 0.5m, so it is not sufficient to clear the hurdle.\n- C. 0.5m: This is the exact height of the hurdle, but in reality, he would need to jump slightly higher to ensure clearance.\n- D. Slightly higher than 0.5m: This is the most accurate answer because it accounts for the need to clear the hurdle without touching it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"30":{"category":"Popular science","question":"I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.

However, I have already spent \\( \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours walking to my friend's house. This leaves no time for the return trip.\n\nSince there is no time left for the return trip, it implies that I would need to run back instantaneously, which is not possible in reality. Therefore, the speed required to double the average speed for the entire trip is infinitely fast.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""}}
