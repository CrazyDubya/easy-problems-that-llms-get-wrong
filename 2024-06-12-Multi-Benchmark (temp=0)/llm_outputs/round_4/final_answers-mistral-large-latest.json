Since there are five bullets in the revolver and one empty chamber, there are six possible positions for the empty chamber (one for each chamber in the revolver).\n\nWhen your opponent fired, the probability of the empty chamber being in the firing position was 1 out of 6. Since the gun didn't fire, we now know that the empty chamber was in the firing position.\n\nIf you choose to spin the chambers again, the empty chamber could end up in any of the six positions with equal probability.

This strategy allows him to test multiple bottles at once, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000 (which requires 10 digits, as 2^10 = 1024).\n2. Assign each digit position to a different prisoner.\n3. If the digit in a prisoner's position is 1, have them drink from the bottle. If it's 0, they don't drink.\n4. After 24 hours, check which prisoners have died. The binary number formed by their positions corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing, with results available in 24 hours.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is also known as a pangrammatic sentence. However, it's important to note that all the options provided reuse certain letters. For instance, 'Dogs bark with me' reuses the letter 'd', 'The five boxers jog quick' reuses several letters such as 'e', 'o', 'b', 'x', 'r', 'j', 'q', 'i', 'c', 'k', and 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' is a well-known pangram, but it also reuses several letters.
