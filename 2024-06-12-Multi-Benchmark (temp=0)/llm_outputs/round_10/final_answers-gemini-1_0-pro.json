Let's break down the situation and analyze the best course of action.\n\n**Initial Situation:**\n\n* You have three doors: one with a gold bar and two with rotten vegetables.\n* You choose Door No. 1.\n\n**Host's Offer:**\n\n* The host, who knows where the gold bar is, opens one of the remaining doors (let's say Door No. 3) to reveal rotten vegetables.\n* He then offers you the chance to switch your choice to the other remaining door (Door No. 2).\n\n**Decision Point:**\n\nThe question is, should you stick with your initial choice (Door No. 1) or switch to Door No. 2?\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* When you initially chose Door No. 1, you had a 1\/3 probability of selecting the door with the gold bar and a 2\/3 probability of choosing a door with rotten vegetables.\n* Once the host reveals a door with rotten vegetables, he is essentially providing you with additional information. This information eliminates one of the losing options, leaving you with two doors: your initial choice (Door No. 1) and the remaining unopened door (Door No. 2).\n* The key point to understand is that the host will always open a door with rotten vegetables, regardless of your initial choice. This means that the information he reveals does not change the probability associated with your initial choice (Door No. 1).\n* However, by switching to Door No. 2, you are essentially transferring your initial 1\/3 probability of winning to the remaining unopened door. This is because the host has essentially confirmed that the remaining unopened door has a higher probability of containing the gold bar than your initial choice.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nTherefore, the choice that gives you the biggest advantage is to **switch to Door No. 2**. By switching, you increase your probability of winning from 1\/3 to 2\/3.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n``` \n","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Your opponent spins the chambers, fires at himself, and survives. He then offers you the choice to spin the chambers again before firing at yourself.\n\n**Analyzing the situation:**\n\n* **Initial state:** Five bullets loaded, one empty chamber.\n* **After opponent's shot:** One chamber is confirmed empty.\n* **Remaining chambers:** Five chambers, unknown status (could be all loaded, some loaded, or all empty).\n\n**Considering the options:**\n\n* **Spin again (A):** This randomizes the chamber positions, making each chamber equally likely to contain the bullet. \n* **Don't spin (C):** The current chamber configuration remains, with the empty chamber's position known.\n* **Probabilities are unknown (B):** While the initial probability of survival was 1\/6, the current probability is uncertain due to the unknown chamber configuration.\n* **No difference (D):** This assumes the outcome is predetermined and unaffected by spinning.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the best option is to **spin the chambers again (A)**. Here's why:\n\n* **Increased information:** Spinning provides more information about the chamber configuration, allowing for a more informed decision.\n* **Equalized chances:** Spinning ensures each chamber has an equal chance of containing the bullet, making the outcome less predictable and potentially increasing your survival odds.\n* **Unknown probabilities:** Since the exact probabilities are unknown after the first shot, spinning offers the best chance of survival by randomizing the situation.\n\nTherefore, the recommended action is to **spin the chambers again (A)** before firing at yourself.\n\n**Answer in JSON format:**\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n``` \n","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

By the time the prisoners identify the bitter bottle, it will be too late.\n* **Option B:** This is a cruel and unnecessary approach. Sacrificing all the prisoners is unethical and avoidable.\n* **Option C:** While this method uses the prisoners to test the wine, it only provides information about one bottle at a time. With 1000 bottles, this approach is inefficient and time-consuming.\n\n**Optimal Solution:**\n\n**Option D:** This is the most efficient and effective approach. By employing a binary search strategy, we can significantly reduce the number of tests required to identify the poisoned bottle. \n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Assign each prisoner a unique binary number from 1 to 10 (e.g., Prisoner 1 = 1, Prisoner 2 = 10, Prisoner 3 = 11, etc.).**\n2. **Divide the bottles into groups based on the binary digits of the prisoner's number.** For example, Prisoner 1 would taste wines 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. (all bottles with a 1 in their binary representation).\n3. **After 24 hours, observe which prisoners are alive and which are dead.**\n4. **Based on the pattern of deaths, narrow down the search space.** If only Prisoner 1 dies, the poisoned bottle is among the bottles he tasted (1, 2, 4, 8, 16). If Prisoners 1 and 2 die, the poisoned bottle is among the bottles they both tasted (1 and 2).\n5. **Repeat steps 2-4 with the remaining bottles and prisoners, using the binary search logic to further refine the search space.**\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n* This method guarantees identifying the poisoned bottle within 24 hours.\n* It minimizes the number of bottles each prisoner needs to taste, reducing the risk of accidental poisoning.\n* It is a logical and efficient approach that leverages the power of binary search.\n\n**Therefore, the optimal answer is D.

Since each pair's birthdays are independent, we multiply the probabilities for each pair.\n\n**Step 2: Complementary Probability**\n\nLet \"n\" be the number of twin pairs. The probability of no shared birthdays is (364\/365)^n.
