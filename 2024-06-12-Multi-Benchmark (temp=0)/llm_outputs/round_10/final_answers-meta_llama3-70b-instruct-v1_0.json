Option A is not feasible because the poison takes effect in 24 hours, so the prisoners won't be able to taste the bitterness immediately. Option B is also not practical because it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is not possible in 24 hours.\n\nOption C is also not the most efficient approach because it would still require a large number of tests. For example, if each prisoner tests 100 bottles, it would take 10 prisoners to test all 1000 bottles, but it's still not guaranteed to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours.\n\nThe correct answer is Option D, which uses a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into two groups of 500 each.\n2. Have one prisoner test one group, and another prisoner test the other group.\n3. Wait 24 hours and see which prisoner dies. The poisoned bottle is in the group that the dead prisoner tested.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 with the remaining group of 500 bottles, dividing it into two groups of 250 each.\n5. Continue this process until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nUsing this binary search strategy, the king can identify the poisoned bottle in at most 10 tests (2^10 = 1024, which is greater than 1000).

We want to find the smallest n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%.\n\nWe can approach this problem by calculating the probability that no two people share a birthday, and then subtracting that from 1 to get the probability that at least two people share a birthday.\n\nThe probability that the first person has a unique birthday is 365\/365 (since there are 365 possible birthdays). The probability that the second person has a unique birthday (different from the first person) is 364\/365. The probability that the third person has a unique birthday (different from the first two) is 363\/365, and so on.\n\nFor 2n people, the probability that all of them have unique birthdays is:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-2n+1)\/365)\n\nWe want to find the smallest n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%, which means the probability of all people having unique birthdays is at most 50%. Using a calculator or computer to compute the above probability, we find that when n = 23, the probability of all people having unique birthdays is approximately 49.3%, which means the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is approximately 50.7%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
