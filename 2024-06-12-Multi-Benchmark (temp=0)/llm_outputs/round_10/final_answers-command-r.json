To find the probability that two people in a room share a birthday, we can use the formula for combinations: C(n, r) = r!(n\u22121)! \/ n!, where n is the number of possible options (366 birthdays) and r is the number of people in the room. Half of the possible combinations will have matching birthdays. \n\nWe want to achieve a 50% probability, which means we set r to half of the total possible combinations. So, C(366, 2) = 732 choose 2. This probability is the chance that any two people in the room have matching birthdays. With 23 pairs of twins, we'd have 46 people in the room, which exceeds the required probability.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

However, by filling up the 5-gallon jug and transferring its contents into the 3-gallon jug twice, we can achieve the desired 4 gallons in the end.
