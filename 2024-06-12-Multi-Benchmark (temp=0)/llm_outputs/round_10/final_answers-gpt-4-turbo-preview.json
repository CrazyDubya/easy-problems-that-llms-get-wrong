Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"This problem is a classic example of the Monty Hall problem. Here's the explanation:\n\nWhen you initially choose a door (let's say door No. 1), there's a 1\/3 chance that you've picked the door with the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance that the gold bar is behind one of the other two doors. When the host, who knows what's behind each door, offers you the chance to switch to door No. 2, the probabilities don't simply split evenly because the host's action of offering a switch is based on your initial choice.\n\nIf the gold bar was behind door No. 1 (your initial choice), switching to door No. 2 would mean you lose. This scenario has a 1\/3 probability since there was a 1\/3 chance the gold bar was behind door No. 1 to begin with.\n\nHowever, if the gold bar was not behind door No. 1 (and thus behind either door No. 2 or No. 3), the host's offer to switch to door No. 2 means you would win by switching. This scenario has a 2\/3 probability since there was a 2\/3 chance the gold bar was behind one of the doors you didn't initially pick.\n\nTherefore, switching doors (to door No. 2 in this case) after the host offers you the chance increases your probability of winning the gold bar from 1\/3 to 2\/3. The host's action of offering a switch after revealing that one of the doors you didn't pick has rotten vegetables effectively transfers the 2\/3 probability of winning from the two doors you didn't initially pick to the one door you're offered to switch to.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

When your opponent spins the chambers and pulls the trigger without a bullet firing, the chance of that happening was 1 out of 6, since there was only 1 empty chamber out of 6.\n\nIf you choose not to spin the chambers again, you now face a situation where there are 5 bullets in 5 chambers because one chamber (the one that was empty) is now known not to be in the firing position. This means you have a 100% chance of hitting a bullet if you do not spin.\n\nHowever, if you choose to spin the chambers again, the probability resets to what it was initially, which is 5 chances out of 6 of hitting a bullet and 1 chance out of 6 of not hitting a bullet. This is because spinning the chamber randomizes the position of the bullets again, making each chamber equally likely to be in the firing position.\n\nTherefore, spinning the chambers again gives you a better chance of survival (1 out of 6 chance of not hitting a bullet) compared to not spinning (0 out of 5 chance of not hitting a bullet).\n\nThe correct choice is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

This prevents the goat from eating the cabbage or the wolf from eating the goat while the farmer is making other trips. (Crossing 1)\n2. The farmer returns alone to the original side to get either the wolf or the cabbage. Let's say he takes the wolf next. (Crossing 2)\n3. The farmer leaves the wolf on the other side and takes the goat back with him to the original side. This is because leaving the wolf and the goat together would result in the goat being eaten. (Crossing 3)\n4. The farmer then takes the cabbage across the river, leaving it with the wolf. The wolf won't eat the cabbage, so it's safe to leave them together. (Crossing 4)\n5.

The classic answer to the traditional birthday problem is 23 people. However, this question modifies the scenario to involve pairs of twins.\n\nSince each pair of twins shares the same birthday, the question essentially simplifies to how many individual birthdays need to be represented to reach a 50% chance of a shared birthday.

Therefore, the presence of one pair of twins does not change the probability calculation from the standard birthday problem; it's the number of unique birthdays (or pairs of twins, in this case) that matters.\n\nThus, you still only need 23 unique birthdays (or 23 pairs of twins) to surpass the 50% threshold of having at least two people (or in this case, two pairs of twins) share the same birthday.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

We need to find the speed at which you must run back to make the average speed for the entire trip double the walking speed of 3 mph.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(d\\) as the distance to your friend's house (and thus the total round trip distance is \\(2d\\)),\n- \\(v_1 = 3\\) mph as the walking speed,\n- \\(v_2\\) as the unknown running speed back,\n- \\(T_1\\) as the time to walk to your friend's house,\n- \\(T_2\\) as the time to run back.\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip, \\(V_{avg}\\), is defined as the total distance divided by the total time. We want this average speed to be double the walking speed, so \\(V_{avg} = 2 \\times 3 = 6\\) mph.\n\nThe time to walk to your friend's house is \\(T_1 = \\frac{d}{v_1} = \\frac{d}{3}\\).\n\nThe time to run back is \\(T_2 = \\frac{d}{v_2}\\).\n\nThe total distance for the round trip is \\(2d\\), and the total time is \\(T_1 + T_2 = \\frac{d}{3} + \\frac{d}{v_2}\\).\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is thus:\n\\[V_{avg} = \\frac{Total\\ Distance}{Total\\ Time} = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{3} + \\frac{d}{v_2}}\\]\n\nWe set \\(V_{avg} = 6\\) mph and solve for \\(v_2\\):\n\\[6 = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{3} + \\frac{d}{v_2}}\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[6 = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{v_2}}\\]\n\n\\[6 = \\frac{2}{\\frac{v_2 + 3}{3v_2}}\\]\n\n\\[6 = \\frac{6v_2}{v_2 + 3}\\]\n\n\\[6v_2 + 18 = 6v_2\\]\n\nThis equation simplifies to an identity that does not help us solve for \\(v_2\\) because we made a mistake in the manipulation. Let's correct the approach:\n\nGiven that we want the average speed to be 6 mph for the entire trip, and knowing that the average speed is the total distance divided by the total time, let's correct the setup:\n\n\\[6 = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{3} + \\frac{d}{v_2}}\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by the denominator to clear the fraction:\n\\[6\\left(\\frac{d}{3} + \\frac{d}{v_2}\\right) = 2d\\]\n\n\\[2d + \\frac{6d}{v_2} = 2d\\]\n\nThis simplification was incorrect. The correct approach is to recognize that to double the average speed to 6 mph, the total time for both the walk and run must fit the requirements of the average speed calculation without making algebraic errors. Let's directly address the solution without further incorrect algebraic manipulation:\n\nTo double the average speed to 6 mph, considering the mistake in algebra, we need to correctly calculate the necessary speed \\(v_2\\) without the algebraic mistake. The correct approach involves understanding that the time taken for both legs of the trip must allow for an average speed of 6 mph. Given the initial mistake in calculation, let's directly address the conceptual solution:\n\nIf the walking speed is 3 mph and we want the average speed for the round trip to be 6 mph, we intuitively know that the speed coming back cannot simply be a finite number like 9 or 12 mph to average out to 6 mph, considering the time factor and the way averages work in this context. The correct answer, considering the mistake in the algebraic manipulation, is to recognize that doubling the average speed in such a manner by running back is not achievable by simply doubling the return speed or any finite speed increase due to the way average speeds are calculated over a round trip. The initial setup led to a confusion in the calculation process.\n\nGiven the nature of the question and the error in the algebraic approach, the correct conceptual answer reflecting on the impossibility of achieving such a condition with a finite speed, considering the mistake in calculation, would be:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""}}
