The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nD. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n\nExplanation:\nThe fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink a small amount of wine from each bottle in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours. If none of the prisoners die, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was not tested. If a prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in their group.\n4. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles and prisoners, dividing the bottles into smaller groups each time until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time possible, while minimizing the number of prisoners who are exposed to the poison.\n\nOption A is not feasible because the poison takes 24 hours to take effect, so the prisoners would not be able to identify the poisoned bottle based on taste alone.\n\nOption B is not ethical because it would require all of the prisoners to consume the poison, which could result in unnecessary deaths.\n\nOption C is not practical because it would require each prisoner to drink from all 1000 bottles, which would take too long and could result in multiple prisoners dying from the poison.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
