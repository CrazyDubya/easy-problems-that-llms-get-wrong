Here's how:\n\n1. First, divide the horses into two groups of three and race them separately. This will give you the fastest horse from each group. Let's call these horses A and B.\n\n2. Next, race horses A and B against each other. The winner of this race is the fastest horse overall.\n\n3. But there's still one more race needed. The loser of the second race (between A and B) could either be the second, third, fourth, or fifth fastest horse. To determine the second fastest horse, race the loser of the second race against the second-place horses from the first two races.\n\nSo, the minimum number of races needed to determine the fastest horse among six is three.","score":""},"2":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a gold bar; behind the others, rotten vegetables.

This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000. Since 10 bits are required to represent numbers up to 1000, each bottle can be represented by a 10-digit binary number.\n\n2. Assign each of the 10 prisoners to one of the 10 binary digits.\n\n3. For each prisoner, prepare a mixture of sips from all the bottles where the corresponding binary digit is 1. For example, if a bottle's binary representation is 1010101010, the prisoner assigned to the first digit would get a sip from this bottle, but the prisoner assigned to the second digit would not.\n\n4. After 24 hours, the king can look at which prisoners have died and read off the binary number directly. If the first and third prisoners died, for example, the poisoned bottle would be represented by the binary number 101 (which is 5 in decimal).\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours, and it only requires 10 tests (one for each prisoner).\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
