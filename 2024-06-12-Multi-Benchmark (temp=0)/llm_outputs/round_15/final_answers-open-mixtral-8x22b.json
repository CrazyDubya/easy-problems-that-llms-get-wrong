The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 is still 1\/3, but the probability that it's behind Door No. 2 is now 2\/3 (since the combined probability of the gold bar being behind Door No. 2 or Door No. 3 was 2\/3, and we know it's not behind Door No. 3).

The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC.

This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them taste a small amount of wine from each bottle in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see if any prisoners die.\n4. If a prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in their group. If no prisoners die, then the poisoned bottle is not in any of the groups tested.\n5. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles, dividing them into smaller groups and assigning them to the surviving prisoners.\n6. Continue this process until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle with the minimum number of tests and in the shortest amount of time possible.\n\nOption A is not feasible because the poison takes 24 hours to take effect, so the prisoners would not be able to identify the poisoned bottle by taste alone.\n\nOption C is unethical and would result in the death of a prisoner.\n\nOption D is also unethical and would result in the death of all the prisoners. Additionally, it would not provide any useful information because the king would not know which bottle was poisoned until all the prisoners had died.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

However, we can use a variable, let's say 'd', to represent the distance.\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time taken. Since the goal is to double the average speed, we need to find the speed required to run back that would result in an average speed of 6mph (twice the walking speed).\n\nLet's denote the running speed as 'r'. The time taken to walk to the friend's house is 'd\/3' (distance divided by walking speed), and the time taken to run back is 'd\/r' (distance divided by running speed).\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is then:\n\nAverage speed = Total distance \/ Total time\nAverage speed = 2d \/ (d\/3 + d\/r)\n\nWe want this average speed to be 6mph, so we set up the equation:\n\n6 = 2d \/ (d\/3 + d\/r)\n\nTo solve for 'r', we can simplify the equation:\n\n6 = 2 \/ (1\/3 + 1\/r)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (1\/3 + 1\/r) gives:\n\n6 * (1\/3 + 1\/r) = 2\n\n2 + 6\/r = 2\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides gives:\n\n6\/r = 0\n\nThis equation has no solution, which means that it's not possible to double the average speed by running back at any finite speed.
