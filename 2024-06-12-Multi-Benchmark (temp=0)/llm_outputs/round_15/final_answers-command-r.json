Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n\nThere are 365 days in a year, so the probability of two people having the same birthday is 1\/365. With one pair of twins, the likelihood of them having the same birthday is 1, and the chance of them not having the same birthday as each other is 364\/365. With two pairs of twins, the probability of them having the same birthday becomes 1 \u00d7 1\/365 + 364\/365 \u00d7 363\/365 = 2\/365.\n\nWe can continue this process to determine that with three pairs of twins, the probability becomes 2 \u00d7 1\/365 + 364 \u00d7 363\/3652 = 4\/365. Four pairs yield 4 \u00d7 1\/365 + 364 \u00d7 3\/3653 = 8\/365, and five pairs give us 8 \u00d7 1\/365 + 364 \u00d7 7\/3654 = 16\/365.\n\nAssuming that each new pair of twins increases the total probability by the ratio of the previous calculation, the answer required will be the one which divides 365 by half: 365\/2, which is 182.5. This number is closest to the option C. 23 pairs.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
