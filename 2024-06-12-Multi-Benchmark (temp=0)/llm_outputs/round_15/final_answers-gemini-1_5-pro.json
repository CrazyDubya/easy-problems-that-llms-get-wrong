The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is B and how it works:\n\n* **A is incorrect** because the poison is tasteless, only turning bitter after a significant amount of time has passed. \n* **C is incorrect** because it only tests 10 bottles at a time, leaving 990 bottles untested.\n* **D is incorrect** because it's impractical and doesn't leverage the information about the poison's delayed effect.\n\n**B is correct: The Binary Search Strategy**\n\n1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10. Convert each prisoner's number into its binary equivalent (e.g., Prisoner 1 is 001, Prisoner 2 is 010, Prisoner 3 is 011, etc.).  Each digit in the binary number represents a specific group of bottles.\n\n2. **Assigning Wine:** Each bottle of wine is also assigned a number from 1 to 1000.  Each prisoner will drink from bottles whose number, when converted to binary, has a '1' in the position corresponding to their assigned prisoner number. \n\n   * For example: Bottle 5 (binary 0101) would be drunk by prisoners 1 and 3.\n\n3. **Observation:** After 24 hours, observe which prisoners have died. Construct a binary number where '1' represents a dead prisoner and '0' represents a living prisoner. This binary number, when converted to decimal, will be the number of the poisoned bottle.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIf prisoners 1 and 3 die, the binary number is 0101, which converts to decimal 5, indicating bottle number 5 is poisoned.\n\n**Why this works:** Binary search is highly efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles simultaneously. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
