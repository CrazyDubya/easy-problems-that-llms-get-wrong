Since the poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption, we can use a binary search strategy to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into two groups of 500 each.\n2. Have 1 prisoner drink from each bottle in the first group, and another prisoner drink from each bottle in the second group.\n3. Wait 24 hours. If a prisoner dies, the poisoned bottle is in the group they drank from. If no prisoners die, the poisoned bottle is in the other group.\n4.
