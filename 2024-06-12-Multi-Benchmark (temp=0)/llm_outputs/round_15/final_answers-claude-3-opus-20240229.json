What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nD. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"Here is my analysis:\n\nThe key to solving this efficiently is to use the 10 prisoners in a way that minimizes the number of tests needed to identify the single poisoned bottle out of 1000. A binary search strategy is optimal.\n\nWith 10 prisoners, you can represent up to 2^10 = 1024 different states in binary. Assign each bottle a unique 10-digit binary number from 0000000000 to 1111101000 (bottle 1000). \n\nFor each prisoner, if the digit corresponding to that prisoner is 1 in a bottle's binary number, have that prisoner take a sip from that bottle. After 24 hours, look at which prisoners have died. The binary number represented by the dead\/alive states of the 10 prisoners will point to the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 9 die, that maps to binary 1000100010, or bottle 546. This strategy guarantees finding the poisoned bottle in just 24 hours with 10 prisoners.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
