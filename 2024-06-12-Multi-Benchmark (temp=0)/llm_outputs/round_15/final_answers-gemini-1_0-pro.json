This approach leverages the power of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests required. \n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Label the bottles:** Assign a unique binary number (from 0 to 999) to each of the 1000 bottles.\n2. **Divide the bottles:** Divide the bottles into 10 groups, each containing 100 bottles.\n3. **First round:** Give each prisoner one bottle from each group (10 bottles total). After 24 hours, observe which prisoners are poisoned.\n4. **Identify the poisoned group:** The poisoned group will be the one where all the poisoned prisoners drank from.\n5. **Repeat with binary search:** Within the poisoned group, repeat the process by dividing the remaining 100 bottles into 10 groups of 10 and assigning each prisoner one bottle from each group. After another 24 hours, identify the poisoned subgroup.\n6. **Continue until one bottle remains:** Continue this binary search process, dividing the remaining bottles into smaller and smaller groups until only one bottle remains. This final bottle will be the poisoned one.\n\nThis approach guarantees identifying the poisoned bottle within 24 hours using only 10 prisoners. Each round of testing eliminates half of the remaining possibilities, leading to a logarithmic reduction in the number of tests needed. \n\n## Conclusion:\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n```json\n{\n\"ANSWER\": \"B\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:** \n\nOption B utilizes the efficient binary search strategy, minimizing the number of tests required and ensuring the identification of the poisoned bottle within the 24-hour timeframe. \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This involves calculating the probability of **not** having shared birthdays and subtracting it from 1.\n\n**Step 1: Probability of No Shared Birthdays**\n\nFor the first twin pair, the probability of not sharing a birthday with anyone is 364\/365 (since there are 364 days that are not their birthday). For the second pair, the probability of not sharing a birthday with anyone (including the first pair) is 363\/365. This continues for each subsequent pair.\n\nTherefore, the probability of **no shared birthdays** for all `n` pairs is:\n\n```\n(364\/365) * (363\/365) * ... * ((365-n)\/365)\n```\n\n**Step 2: Complementary Probability**\n\nThe probability of **at least one shared birthday** is the complement of the probability of no shared birthdays. So:\n\n```\nP(at least one shared birthday) = 1 - P(no shared birthdays)\n```\n\n**Step 3: Solving for n**\n\nWe want this probability to be at least 50%. So, we set up the inequality:\n\n```\n1 - (364\/365) * (363\/365) * ... * ((365-n)\/365) >= 0.5\n```\n\nSolving this inequality numerically, we find that `n` needs to be at least **23**.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nWe need at least 23 pairs of twins in a room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.
