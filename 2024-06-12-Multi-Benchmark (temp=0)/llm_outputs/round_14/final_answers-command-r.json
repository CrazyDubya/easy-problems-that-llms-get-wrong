With 2 pairs, the probability increases to 1\/365 * 1\/364 = 1\/133,055. \n\nWe can continue this multiplication to determine the probability with more pairs of twins:\n\n3 pairs: 1\/365 * 1\/364 * 1\/363 = 1\/47,400,355\n\n4 pairs: 1\/156,843,775\n\n5 pairs: 1\/2,118,969,930\n\n6 pairs: 1\/33,233,416,150\n\nAs we can see, the probability significantly increases with each additional pair of twins.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n\nMy thinking goes as follows: walking at 3mph on the way to my friend's house means the entire trip takes 1 hour because 3 miles \/ 3 hours = 1 mile per hour. To double my average speed for the return trip, I need to complete the same distance in half the time. This means running at 6mph won't double my average speed because 3 hours is only half of the time I'd spend running at 6mph (3 miles \/ 6 hours = 0.5 miles per hour). Therefore, I'd need to run at 9mph to complete the return trip in 1 hour and double my average speed for the entire trip. However, this doesn't account for the time it takes to walk the first 3 miles, so the true average speed would still be less than 9mph. To achieve a true average speed of 9mph, I would need to run faster than 9mph during the return trip to make up for the slower walking speed on the first half of the trip. Therefore, the correct answer is C: 12mph.","score":""}}
