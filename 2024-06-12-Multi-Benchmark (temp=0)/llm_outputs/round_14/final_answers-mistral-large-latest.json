This strategy allows him to test multiple bottles at once, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000 (which requires 10 digits, as 2^10 = 1024).\n2. Assign each digit position to a different prisoner.\n3. If the digit in a prisoner's position is 1, have them drink from the bottle.\n4. After 24 hours, if a prisoner is dead, it means that the bottles they drank from (those with a 1 in their assigned position) contain the poison. If multiple prisoners are dead, the poisoned bottle's binary number will be the combination of the 1s in their positions.\n\nBy using this method, the king can identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours, and he only needs 10 prisoners to do so.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

In the classic birthday problem, you're looking for the probability that at least two people in a group share a birthday. With twins, we know that each pair of twins shares a birthday.\n\nHowever, the twist here is that we're looking for the probability that two people from different pairs of twins share a birthday. This is because if we only have one pair of twins, there's a 100% chance that two people in the room share a birthday, but they're the twins themselves.\n\nSo, we need to consider the number of individuals, not the number of pairs of twins. Each twin counts as an individual when we're calculating the probability that two people from different pairs share a birthday.\n\nThe classic birthday problem tells us that we need 23 individuals for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people share a birthday. Since each pair of twins counts as two individuals, we need 23 divided by 2, which is 11.5.
