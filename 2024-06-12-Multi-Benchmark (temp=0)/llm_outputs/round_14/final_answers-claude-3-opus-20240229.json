Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"Here is my analysis:\n\nThe key to solving this efficiently is to use the 10 prisoners in a way that minimizes the number of tests needed to identify the poisoned bottle out of 1000 bottles. A binary search strategy is optimal.\n\nAssign each bottle a unique 10-digit binary number (e.g. 0000000001, 0000000010, etc.). Have each prisoner sample the bottles corresponding to the digit position they are assigned (e.g. prisoner 1 samples all bottles ending in 1, prisoner 2 samples bottles ending in 1 in the 2nd digit, etc.). \n\nAfter 24 hours, the prisoners who sampled the poisoned bottle will have died. The positions of the dead prisoners will correspond to the binary encoding of the poisoned bottle. For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 10 died, the poisoned bottle's binary number ends in 1000000001, uniquely identifying it.\n\nThis leverages the prisoners as \"bits\" to efficiently search the sample space in one 24-hour period with no additional tests needed. The other options require far more time or prisoners to identify the bottle.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
