Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"Here's my explanation and answer:\n\nThe key to this problem is to use the prisoners efficiently to test the wine and minimize the number of tests needed. Option A is not feasible because the poison takes effect in 24 hours, so the prisoners won't be able to taste the bitterness immediately. Option D is also not practical because it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is not possible in 24 hours.\n\nOption B is a possible solution, but it's not the most efficient way. If we divide the bottles among the 10 prisoners, each prisoner would have to test around 100 bottles. This means that in the worst-case scenario, we would need 100 tests to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nThe most efficient solution is Option C, which uses a binary search strategy. We can assign a binary number to each bottle, from 0 to 999 (since there are 1000 bottles). Then, we can divide the prisoners into two groups: one group tests the bottles with a 0 in the most significant bit (MSB) position, and the other group tests the bottles with a 1 in the MSB position. This way, we can eliminate half of the bottles with just one test.\n\nWe can repeat this process for the next 9 bits, using the remaining prisoners to test the bottles. Since there are 10 prisoners, we can test 10 bits in parallel. This means we can identify the poisoned bottle in just 10 tests, which can be completed in 24 hours.\n\nHere's the answer in JSON format:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
