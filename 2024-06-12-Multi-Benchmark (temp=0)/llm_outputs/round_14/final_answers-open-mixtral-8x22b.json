This method minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from one bottle in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours. If a prisoner dies, the poisoned bottle is in their group. If no one dies, the poisoned bottle is in the remaining 900 bottles.\n4. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles and prisoners until the poisoned bottle is found.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time possible, while minimizing the number of prisoners who need to be sacrificed.\n\nOption A is not feasible because the poison is bitter, but so are many other substances, and the prisoners may not be able to accurately identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nOption B is unethical and would result in the death of at least one prisoner.\n\nOption D is also unethical and would result in the death of all 10 prisoners if they all sampled the poisoned bottle.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

However, the question is specifically asking about pairs of twins, which means each pair shares the same birthday.\n\nSince each pair of twins shares the same birthday, we only need to consider the number of pairs, not the total number of people. To have at least a 50% chance that two people (in this case, two pairs of twins) have the same birthday, we only need two pairs of twins. This is because the first pair of twins will have a different birthday than the second pair of twins with a probability of 364\/365 (assuming 365 days in a year and ignoring leap years), and the probability that the second pair of twins has a different birthday than the first pair is also 364\/365. Therefore, the probability that both pairs of twins have different birthdays is (364\/365) * (364\/365), which is less than 50%.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 1 pair\n\nHowever, this answer assumes that the question is asking for the minimum number of pairs of twins needed to have at least a 50% chance that two pairs of twins share the same birthday. If the question is asking for the number of pairs of twins needed to have at least a 50% chance that any two people in the room share the same birthday (including non-twin siblings or unrelated individuals), then the answer would be different and would require a more complex calculation.\n\nHere's the JSON format:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
