Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nD. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy. This strategy is based on the concept of binary numbers, where each test can be considered a digit in a binary number, and each prisoner can be considered a 'bit' in that digit.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000 (which can be represented using 10 digits in binary).\n2. For each test (or digit), assign a bottle to a prisoner if the corresponding digit in the bottle's binary number is 1. If the digit is 0, the prisoner does not drink from the bottle.\n3. After 24 hours, the prisoners who survive did not drink from the poisoned bottle. The prisoners who die drank from the poisoned bottle.\n4. The binary number corresponding to the poisoned bottle is the one where the digits match the prisoners who died.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 2, and 8 die, then the poisoned bottle is the one labeled with the binary number 10000011 (which is 131 in decimal).\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one day, as he can test up to 1024 bottles with 10 prisoners using this method.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
