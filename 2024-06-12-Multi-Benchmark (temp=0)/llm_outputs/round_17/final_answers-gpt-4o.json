This action provides additional information.\n\n3. **Switching vs. Staying**:\n   - If you **stay** with your initial choice (Door No. 1), the probability of winning the gold bar remains 1\/3.\n   - If you **switch** to the other unopened door (in this case, Door No. 2), the probability of winning the gold bar increases to 2\/3. This is because the host's action of revealing a rotten vegetable behind one of the other doors effectively transfers the probability of the gold bar being behind one of the other two doors to the remaining unopened door.\n\nTherefore, switching doors gives you a higher probability of winning the gold bar.\n\nGiven the options, the best choice is to switch to Door No. 2.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This means there is one empty chamber. When your opponent spins the chambers and fires, he lands on the empty chamber. Now, there are five chambers left, and four of them contain bullets.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, you are left with the current configuration where there are five chambers, and you know one of them is empty (the one your opponent just fired). The probability of you landing on the empty chamber is 1 in 5, or 20%.\n\nIf you spin the chambers again, you reset the probabilities to the initial state where there are six chambers, and one of them is empty. The probability of you landing on the empty chamber is 1 in 6, or approximately 16.67%.\n\nComparing the two probabilities:\n- Not spinning: 20% chance of survival\n- Spinning: 16.67% chance of survival\n\nSince 20% is higher than 16.67%, you have a better chance of survival if you do not spin the chambers again.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is not to spin the chambers again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Given that we have 10 prisoners and 1000 bottles, we can use a binary representation strategy to achieve this.\n\nEach bottle can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is more than enough to cover 1000 bottles). We can assign each prisoner to a specific bit position in these binary numbers. \n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Label each bottle with a number from 0 to 999.\n2. Convert each bottle number to its 10-bit binary equivalent.\n3. Assign each prisoner to a specific bit position (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit).\n4. Have each prisoner drink from all the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1.\n\nFor example, if bottle number 5 (which is 0000000101 in binary) is poisoned, prisoners assigned to the 1st and 3rd bits will drink from it. If both prisoners die, we can deduce that the poisoned bottle is number 5.\n\nBy observing which prisoners die after 24 hours, we can reconstruct the binary number of the poisoned bottle. This method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with a maximum of 10 prisoners in a single round of testing.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"To determine how fast I would need to run back to double my average speed for the entire trip, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the distance to my friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_1 \\) be the time it takes to walk to my friend's house.\n   - Let \\( v_r \\) be the speed I need to run back.\n\n2. **Calculate Time to Walk to Friend's House:**\n   - I walk to my friend's house at 3 mph.\n   - Time to walk to my friend's house, \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n\n3. **Total Distance and Desired Average Speed:**\n   - The total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\).\n   - I want to double my average speed for the entire trip, so the desired average speed is \\( 2 \\times 3 \\) mph = 6 mph.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Time for Desired Average Speed:**\n   - The total time for the round trip to achieve an average speed of 6 mph is \\( \\frac{2d}{6} = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n\n5. **Calculate Time to Run Back:**\n   - Let \\( t_2 \\) be the time to run back.\n   - The total time for the round trip is \\( t_1 + t_2 \\).\n   - We know \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( \\frac{d}{3} + t_2 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n\n6. **Solve for \\( t_2 \\):**\n   - \\( \\frac{d}{3} + t_2 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n   - Subtract \\( \\frac{d}{3} \\) from both sides: \\( t_2 = 0 \\).\n\n7. **Calculate Speed to Run Back:**\n   - If \\( t_2 = 0 \\), the speed \\( v_r \\) must be infinitely fast because it would take no time to cover the distance \\( d \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""}}
