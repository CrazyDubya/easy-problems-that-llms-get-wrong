Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n\nExplanation:\nThe fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from one bottle in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoner, if any, was affected by the poison.\n4. If none of the prisoners were affected, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was not tested. Repeat the process with the remaining group.\n5. If one prisoner was affected, then the poisoned bottle is in their group. Divide that group into 10 subgroups of 10 bottles each and repeat the process with the remaining prisoners.\n6. Continue this process until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time possible, while minimizing the number of prisoners who are exposed to the poison.\n\nOption A is not a viable solution because it would require all prisoners to drink from all 1000 bottles, which would take too long and expose all prisoners to the poison.\n\nOption B is not a viable solution because it would only identify the poisoned bottle after a prisoner has died, which is not ideal.\n\nOption C is not a viable solution because the poison may not have a bitter taste, and relying on taste alone could lead to false positives or false negatives.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
