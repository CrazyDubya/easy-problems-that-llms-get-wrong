This action doesn't change the initial odds that your first door was correct (still 1\/3). However, the key is that the host's knowledge of where the prize is allows them to concentrate the remaining probability.\n* **The Switch:** When you switch to door No. 2, you're essentially taking advantage of the combined 2\/3 probability that the gold bar was initially behind one of the doors you *didn't* pick.

Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"D\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the answer is D and an explanation of the strategy:\\n\\n**Why other options won't work:**\\n* **A & B:**  These are incredibly unethical and inefficient.  You'd likely kill all your prisoners without even guaranteeing you find the poisoned bottle.\\n* **C:**  The poison takes effect after 24 hours, so a bitter taste won't be an immediate indicator.\\n\\n**The Solution: Binary Search**\\n\\n1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10. Convert each prisoner's number into its binary equivalent (e.g., Prisoner 1 is 001, Prisoner 2 is 010, Prisoner 3 is 011, etc.).\\n\\n2. **Labeling Bottles:**  Imagine each bottle has a 10-digit binary code (from 0000000001 to 1111111111).  \\n\\n3. **Assigning Sips:** Each prisoner will take a tiny sip from bottles corresponding to the '1' digits in their assigned binary number. For example:\\n    * Prisoner 1 (0000000001) drinks from bottle #1.\\n    * Prisoner 2 (0000000010) drinks from bottle #2.\\n    * Prisoner 3 (0000000011) drinks from bottles #1 and #2.\\n    * ...and so on.\\n\\n4. **Decoding the Outcome:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died. Construct a binary number where '1' represents a dead prisoner and '0' a living one. This binary number will directly correspond to the poisoned bottle number.\\n\\n**Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0001000101, which converts to the decimal number 261. Bottle #261 was poisoned.\\n\\n**Why Binary Search is Optimal:** This method allows you to test up to 1024 (2^10) bottles with just 10 prisoners. It's the most efficient way to narrow down the possibilities.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
