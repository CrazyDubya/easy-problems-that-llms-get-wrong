The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"Here is my analysis of the question and answers:\n\nThe key constraints are:\n- There are 1000 bottles of wine and only 1 is poisoned\n- The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption \n- The king only has 10 prisoners to test the wine\n- He needs to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours\n\nAnswer A is the correct approach. By using a binary search strategy and assigning each prisoner a \"binary digit\", you can uniquely identify up to 2^10 = 1024 bottles with just 10 prisoners. \n\nFor example, label the bottles 0 to 999 and write those numbers in binary. Wherever there is a 1 in the binary representation, have the corresponding prisoner take a sip from that bottle. After 24 hours, see which prisoners died. The binary number formed by the dead prisoners will tell you the number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis allows you to definitively identify the single poisoned bottle within the 24 hour time limit while minimizing the testing.\n\nThe other answers either require more than 24 hours (B, C) or don't conclusively identify the poisoned bottle (D). So A is the best answer.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
