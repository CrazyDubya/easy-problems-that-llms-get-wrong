The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"A\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the answer is A and how it works:\\n\\n* **The Problem:** Identify one poisoned bottle out of 1000 with only 10 test subjects and a 24-hour time limit. \\n* **Why A is Correct (Binary Search):**\\n    * **Number Representation:**  Think of each prisoner as representing a bit in a binary number. With 10 prisoners, you can represent numbers up to 1023 (2^10 - 1). \\n    * **Labeling and Assignment:**  Label each bottle with a number from 1 to 1000. Convert each bottle's number into its binary equivalent. Each prisoner is assigned a 'bit position' in the binary number (e.g., Prisoner 1 = the ones place, Prisoner 2 = the twos place, etc.).  Prisoners drink from a bottle if their 'bit position' is a '1' in the bottle's binary representation.\\n    * **Decoding the Result:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die. The binary representation of the poisoned bottle's number is formed by noting which prisoners died. For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0011000001, which translates to 801 \u2013 that's the poisoned bottle.\\n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\\n    * **B:** This approach only works if you have as many prisoners as bottles, which is not the case here.\\n    * **C:** This is incredibly inefficient and doesn't guarantee finding the poisoned bottle.\\n    * **D:** The poison only takes effect after 24 hours, so taste is not a factor.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
