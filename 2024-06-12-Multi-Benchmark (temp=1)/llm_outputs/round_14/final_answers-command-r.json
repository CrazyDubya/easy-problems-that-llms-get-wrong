To find the probability that two people in a room share a birthday, we use the formula for combinations: C(n, r) = r!(n\u22121)! \/ r + n\u22121. \n\nWe can describe the scenario using the formula with n = 2 people and r = shared birthday. \n\nThe chance of a shared birthday between two people is 1\/366. With 48 people in the room, the probability that at least two people share a birthday can be calculated as follows: 1 - (365\/366)48 \u2248 0.507. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C: 48 pairs.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
