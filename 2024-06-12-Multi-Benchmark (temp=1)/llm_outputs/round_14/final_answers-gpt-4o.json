Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of why switching doors gives you a bigger chance to win:\n\n1. **Initial Choice**: When you first pick a door (say Door No. 1), there is a 1\/3 chance the gold bar is behind that door and a 2\/3 chance it is behind one of the other two doors.\n\n2. **Host\u2019s Action**: The game show host, who knows what is behind each door, will always offer you to switch after revealing a door with rotten vegetables (which means if you picked the gold bar initially, the host will reveal a door with rotten vegetables). Thus, the host\u2019s action provides a key piece of information.\n\n3. **Effect of Switching**: If you switch after the host reveals one door with rotten vegetables, your winning probability shifts. Here\u2019s the breakdown:\n   - Initially picked the door with the gold bar: 1\/3 chance (you lose if you switch).\n   - Initially picked a door with rotten vegetables: 2\/3 chance (you win if you switch since the gold bar must be behind the only remaining door that hasn't been revealed).\n\nThus, switching doors statistically improves your chances of picking the gold bar from 1\/3 to 2\/3.\n\nGiven this analysis, the choice that maximizes your chance of winning is to switch to the other door, making the best option Door No. 2 since it is the door the host suggests switching to.\n\nHere is the answer in the desired format:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Initially, the probability of your opponent firing a bullet is 5\/6, while the probability of firing an empty chamber is 1\/6. Since your opponent fired and no bullet came out, we know that he hit the one empty chamber.\n\nNow, if you do not spin the chambers again, you know that only one chamber out of the remaining five is empty. Thus, the probability that you will fire a bullet is now 5\/5 (or 100%).\n\nOn the other hand, if you spin the chamber again, the distribution of bullets will reset. Since there are five bullets in six chambers, the probability of firing a bullet returns to 5\/6 (approximately 83.33%).\n\nTherefore, spinning the chamber again reduces your chances of firing a bullet from 100% to approximately 83.33%, which is preferable.\n\nGiven this analysis, the better option is to spin the chamber again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

We can leverage the concept of binary numbers to achieve this.\n\nThe idea is to use each of the 10 prisoners to represent a binary digit (bit). With 10 prisoners, we can represent numbers from 0 to 1023 (which covers all 1000 bottles and then some).\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a number from 1 to 1000, and convert each of these numbers to a 10-bit binary representation.\n2. Each prisoner will drink (or not drink) from a bottle based on a specific bit in its binary representation.\n   - For example, if a bottle is labeled as 1101100111 in binary, the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th prisoners will drink from that bottle.\n3. After 24 hours, determine which prisoners show the effects of poisoning. Record the binary digits where 1 corresponds to a prisoner who was poisoned.\n4. Convert this binary sequence back to a decimal number. This number will indicate the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that you only need one round of testing and efficiently narrows down the exact bottle using the binary information from the 10 prisoners.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct answer conforms to Answer A:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The mass of the tree increases mostly due to the carbon dioxide absorbed from the air, not from the soil itself. Therefore, we assume that the soil's mass remains largely unchanged as the tree grows.\n\nGiven that the tree starts at 2kg and grows to 3kg, the soil's mass does not change simply because of the tree's growth. The original amount of soil is 10kg, and it remains 10kg, provided no soil is removed by other means (e.g., erosion, harvesting).\n\nTherefore, the soil left remains 10kg.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"29":{"category":"Relational","question":"A man steps over a 0.5m hurdle.

First, calculate the time taken to walk to your friend's house. With an average speed of 3 mph for distance \\(d\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Time to walk to friend's house} = \\frac{d}{3} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. To double the average speed for the entire trip, the overall average speed should be \\(2 \\times 3\\) mph = 6 mph.\n\n3. The total distance for the entire round trip is \\(2d\\) miles.\n\n4. If the overall average speed for the entire trip is 6 mph, we must calculate the total time allowed for the round trip:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total time allowed} = \\frac{2d}{6} = \\frac{d}{3} \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. The time taken to walk to the friend's house is already \\(\\frac{d}{3}\\) hours.\n\nThis indicates that there is no time left for the return trip. Thus, you would need to run back instantly or infinitely fast to achieve this overall average speed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""}}
