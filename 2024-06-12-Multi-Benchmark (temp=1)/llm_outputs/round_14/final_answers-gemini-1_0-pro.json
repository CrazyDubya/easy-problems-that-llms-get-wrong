Here's a breakdown of the logic:\n\n1. **Initial Probability:** When you first choose Door 1, you have a 1\/3 chance of it containing the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance of it containing a rotten vegetable (as there are two other doors).\n2. **Host Opens a Door:** The host, who knows where the gold bar is, opens one of the remaining doors, revealing a rotten vegetable (let's say Door 3). This doesn't change the probability that your initial choice (Door 1) contains the gold bar.\n3. **New Information:** The key insight is that the host wouldn't have opened a door with the gold bar. Therefore, the remaining unopened door (Door 2) now has the remaining probability of the gold being there, which was 2\/3 initially.\n4. **Switching vs. Sticking:** If you stick with your initial choice (Door 1), you maintain the 1\/3 chance you had initially. However, if you switch to the unopened door (Door 2), you gain the 2\/3 probability that was concentrated there after the host's reveal.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTherefore, switching to Door 2 gives you the biggest advantage, as it increases your probability of winning the gold bar from 1\/3 to 2\/3.\n\n## Answer\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Therefore, there are now five bullets remaining in the five remaining chambers.\n\nIf you choose not to spin again, the probability of survival on the second spin is also 1\/6 (one empty chamber out of five). \n\nHowever, if you choose to spin again, the empty chamber could potentially move to a different position, altering the probabilities.

Turn each switch on one at a time and observe the bulbs.**\n\nThis approach offers a systematic and efficient way to map each switch to its corresponding lightbulb. Here's why:\n\n* **Systematic:** Turning on each switch individually ensures that you observe the direct effect on each bulb, eliminating ambiguity.\n* **Efficient:** With only three switches and three bulbs, this method requires minimal time and effort.\n* **Safe:** LED bulbs remain cool even when lit, avoiding the risk of burns associated with incandescent bulbs.\n\n**Explanation for other options:**\n\n* **B. Turning two switches on for a while, turn one off, then touching the bulbs to see which is warm and which one is on:** This method relies on the assumption that incandescent bulbs are used, which is not specified in the question. Additionally, touching potentially hot bulbs introduces safety risks.\n* **C. Turning all of the switches on at once and observing the bulbs:** While seemingly faster, this approach could lead to confusion, as it becomes difficult to associate each lit bulb with its corresponding switch.\n* **D.

This method leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests required. \n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Label the bottles:** Assign a unique binary code (from 0 to 999) to each of the 1000 bottles. \n2. **Divide the bottles:** Give each prisoner a set of bottles based on their binary code. For example, the first prisoner receives bottles 0, 1, 2, and 3, the second prisoner receives bottles 4, 5, 6, and 7, and so on.\n3. **Observe and record:** After 24 hours, observe which prisoners are poisoned. \n4. **Refine the search:** Based on the poisoned prisoners, narrow down the search space by half. For example, if prisoners 1, 2, and 3 are poisoned, the poisoned bottle must be among bottles 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n5. **Repeat steps 2-4:** Repeat the process of dividing the remaining bottles based on their binary codes among the unaffected prisoners, observing who gets poisoned, and further narrowing down the search space.\n\n**Key advantages of this approach:**\n\n* **Fast:** With each round, the search space is reduced by half, allowing the king to quickly converge on the poisoned bottle. In this scenario, it would take a maximum of **10 rounds (24 hours)** to identify the culprit.\n* **Efficient:** This method requires only a maximum of **10 tastings per round**, minimizing the number of prisoners exposed to the poison.\n\nTherefore, the optimal answer to the question is:\n\n```json\n{\n\"ANSWER\": \"A\" \n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This involves calculating the probability of the opposite event (no shared birthdays) and subtracting it from 1.\n\n**Calculating the Probability of No Shared Birthdays:**\n\nWe can calculate the probability of no shared birthdays by considering each twin pair individually. For the first pair, the probability of not sharing a birthday is 364\/365 (as there are 364 days out of 365 that wouldn't be a match). For the second pair, the probability of not sharing a birthday with either of the first pair, given that the first pair doesn't share, is 363\/365. This continues for each subsequent pair.\n\nTherefore, the probability of no shared birthdays for n pairs of twins is:\n\n```\n(364\/365) * (363\/365) * ... * ((365-n+1)\/365)\n```\n\n**Finding the Minimum Number of Pairs for 50% Chance:**\n\nWe need this probability to be less than or equal to 50%, which translates to:\n\n```\n(364\/365) * (363\/365) * ... * ((365-n+1)\/365) <= 0.5\n```\n\nSolving this inequality numerically, we find that n needs to be at least **23**.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of twin pairs needed for at least a 50% chance of shared birthdays is 23.\n\n**JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n``` \n","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"## Explanation:\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of weighted averages. The average speed for the entire trip is the weighted average of the walking speed and the running speed, weighted by the time spent walking and running respectively. \n\nLet's denote:\n\n* Walking speed as $w = 3$ mph\n* Running speed as $r$ \n* Average speed for the entire trip as $a$\n* Time spent walking as $t_w$\n* Time spent running as $t_r$\n\nWe know that $a = 2w = 6$ mph (double the walking speed). We also know that the total distance covered is the same for both walking and running, so:\n\n$distance = w \\times t_w = r \\times t_r$\n\nSince the distance is the same, we can write:\n\n$t_r = \\frac{w}{r} \\times t_w$\n\nNow, we can plug this expression for $t_r$ into the weighted average formula:\n\n$a = \\frac{w \\times t_w + r \\times t_r}{t_w + t_r}$\n\n$6 = \\frac{3t_w + r \\times \\frac{w}{r} \\times t_w}{t_w + \\frac{w}{r} \\times t_w}$\n\n$6 = \\frac{3t_w + wt_w}{t_w + wt_w}$\n\n$6 = \\frac{t_w(3 + w)}{t_w(1 + w)}$\n\n$6(1 + w) = 3 + w$\n\n$5w = 3$\n\n$w = \\frac{3}{5}$\n\nTherefore, the running speed needs to be:\n\n$r = 2w = \\frac{6}{5} = 1.2$ mph\n\n## Answer:\n\nBased on the calculations above, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n\"ANSWER\": \"D\"\n}\n``` \nThis means the correct answer is **D. 12mph**. \n","score":""}}
