In this case, we have 1000 bottles of wine, and we need to find the poisoned one in 24 hours using 10 prisoners. \n\nThe idea is to assign a binary number to each prisoner, from 1 to 10, using the powers of 2 (2^0 to 2^9). Then, we'll have each prisoner drink a mixture of wines corresponding to the binary digits that are \"on\" (1) in their assigned number. \n\nFor example, prisoner 1 (2^0) drinks from bottles 1, 3, 5, ..., 999 (all bottles where the rightmost binary digit is 1). Prisoner 2 (2^1) drinks from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, ..., 1000 (all bottles where the second-rightmost binary digit is 1). And so on. \n\nAfter 24 hours, we'll see which prisoners die. By analyzing the binary numbers of the dead prisoners, we can determine which bottle is poisoned. \n\nThis strategy allows us to test 1000 bottles with just 10 prisoners in 24 hours.\n\nAnswer:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"Here's my explanation and answer:\n\nThe key to this problem is to recognize that we're not asking about the probability of two specific people having the same birthday, but rather about the probability of at least two people out of a group having the same birthday.\n\nIntuitively, you might think that you need a large number of people in the room for there to be a 50% chance of two people sharing a birthday. However, the probability of two people sharing a birthday is actually much higher than you might think.\n\nTo calculate this probability, we can use the complementary probability, i.e., the probability that no two people share a birthday. If we assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity), then the probability that a single person has a unique birthday is 365\/365 = 1.\n\nThe probability that a second person has a unique birthday (different from the first person) is 364\/365, since there's one fewer day to choose from. The probability that a third person has a unique birthday (different from the first two) is 363\/365, and so on.\n\nTo find the probability that all n people have unique birthdays, we can multiply these probabilities together:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365)\n\nAs n increases, this probability decreases rapidly. In fact, if we set n = 23, we find that the probability of all 23 people having unique birthdays is approximately 0.493, which means that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is approximately 1 - 0.493 = 0.507, or greater than 50%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

This means that there are always empty rooms available, no matter how many guests are currently staying at the hotel.\n\nAt first glance, it might seem like option C, \"By putting the guest in an empty room,\" is the obvious answer. However, this puzzle is trying to trick us into thinking that's the case.\n\nThe correct answer is actually option D, \"You ask each current guest to move to the room number n*2.\" This might seem counterintuitive, but here's why it works:\n\nLet's say the hotel currently has guests in rooms 1, 2, 3, ..., n. To accommodate one more guest, you ask each current guest to move to the room number n*2. This means the guest in room 1 moves to room 2, the guest in room 2 moves to room 4, the guest in room 3 moves to room 6, and so on.\n\nThis creates a vacancy in room 1, which can then be occupied by the new guest.
