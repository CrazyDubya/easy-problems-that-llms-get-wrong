Monty Hall was the host of a TV game show, and this problem is a famous probability puzzle named after him. After you initially pick a door (let's say door No. 1), the host (who knows what's behind each door) then opens one of the other doors (let's say door No. 3) to reveal a goat. This is always guaranteed to happen because the host knows where the car is and deliberately chooses a door with a goat. Now, you have the option of either sticking with your initial choice (door No. 1) or switching to the other unopened door (door No. 2).\n\nIf you stick with the initial door, your probability of winning remains the same as it was when you chose it (1\/3). However, if you switch your choice to the other door, your probability of winning becomes 2\/3.\n\nThe reason for this counter-intuitive increase in the probability of winning after switching is because the host's action of opening another door provides additional information. The host's action effectively narrows down the possibilities: the probability of the car being behind the initially chosen door is still 1\/3, but the probability of the car being behind either of the other two doors is now 2\/3. Since the host has revealed a goat behind one of the other doors, the entire 2\/3 probability shifts to the other unopened door.\n\nSo, the answer is D. Door No.1 if you want to stick to your initial choice, with a probability of winning of 1\/3. But if you want to maximize your probability of winning, you should switch your choice to Door No.2, which now has a probability of 2\/3 of having the gold bar behind it.\n\nHere's the JSON format for the answer:\n{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"D\"\n}\n\nBut please note that to maximize the probability of winning, the strategy should be switching to door No.2, with a winning probability of 2\/3. However, the question asks for the choice of door, and strictly speaking, the initial choice was door No. 1. In terms of probabilities, though, the better choice is switching to door No. 2, as explained above.","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Option C is also not a suitable solution as it risks the lives of all prisoners, and testing every bottle would not guarantee finding the poisoned bottle within 24 hours. Option D is similar to option A as it relies on taste and puts the prisoners at risk.\n\nOption B is the best solution as it leverages binary search strategy. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100, and assign each group to a prisoner.\n2. Have each prisoner drink from their assigned bottles.\n3. Wait 24 hours.\n4. If no one dies, then the poisoned bottle must be in the remaining group of 100 bottles that no one drank from.\n5.

However, the problem presented here is asking for the number of pairs of twins for a 50% chance of any two people sharing the same birthday.\n\nConsidering each pair of twins as 2 people, we are discussing the probability of 2 people sharing the same birthday, which is the core of the birthday problem.\n\nSince the birthday problem suggests that with 23 people, there is approximately a 50% chance of a shared birthday, we will extrapolate this principle to pairs of twins. In this case, each pair of twins counts as 2 people. Therefore, we would need half as many pairs of twins to have a 50% chance of any two people sharing the same birthday.\n\nThe numbers don't perfectly align because the birthday problem doesn't neatly halve due to two people sharing a birthday in each pair of twins. However, the principle holds that with fewer than 23 twins (23 people \/ 2), we would still have a roughly 50% chance of any two people sharing the same birthday.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 23 pairs\n\nHere's the response in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"D\"\n}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
