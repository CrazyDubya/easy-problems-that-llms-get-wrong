Since we need to identify one specific bottle out of 1000, we can think in terms of binary representation.\n\nEach of the 1000 bottles can be numbered from 0 to 999, which can be represented in binary form using 10 bits (since 2^10 = 1024, which is slightly more than 1000). Each prisoner can then correspond to one of these binary place values (1 or 0).\n\nHere\u2019s the step-by-step plan:\n1. Label each of the 1000 bottles with a unique number from 0 to 999.\n2. Convert these numbers into their binary form, which will require 10 bits.\n3. Assign each of the 10 prisoners to one bit position (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit).\n4. Have each prisoner drink from every bottle where the corresponding bit in the bottle's binary number is 1.\n5. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners are alive and which have died. This will give you a 10-bit binary number.\n6. The binary number formed by the states (alive or dead) of the prisoners will directly correspond to the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the single poisoned bottle using a systematic approach without needing to test wine bottles indiscriminately.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Hence, the speed required to run back would have to be infinitely fast.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""}}
