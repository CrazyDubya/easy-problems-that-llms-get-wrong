Assign each bottle a unique 10-digit binary number where each digit maps to a prisoner. For each bottle, have the corresponding prisoners (those with a 1 in their position for that bottle's number) take a sip. After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank the poison will have died. The binary number corresponding to the subset of prisoners who died will identify the poisoned bottle.
