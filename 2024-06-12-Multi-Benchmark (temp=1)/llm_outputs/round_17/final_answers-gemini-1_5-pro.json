Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's the breakdown of why the answer is B and why the others won't work:\n\n* **A is incorrect** because the poison doesn't work immediately. The prisoners won't know which bottle is poisoned until it's too late.\n\n* **C is incorrect**  because it's needlessly cruel and inefficient.  You only need a tiny amount of poisoned wine to kill someone, so you can test many bottles with fewer prisoners.\n\n* **D is incorrect** for the same reason as A \u2013 the poison's delayed effect makes this strategy useless.\n\n**B is the correct answer because of the efficiency of binary search:**\n\n1. **Number the prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n\n2. **Number the bottles:**  Think in binary. Each bottle gets a number from 0 to 999. Convert each bottle's number into its binary representation (e.g., Bottle 5 is 000000101).\n\n3. **Each prisoner gets a sip from specific bottles:**  Prisoner #1 takes a sip from every bottle where the *rightmost* binary digit is a 1. Prisoner #2 drinks from bottles where the *second from the right* binary digit is a 1, and so on. \n\n4. **Observe after 24 hours:** The prisoners who die represent a '1' in their corresponding binary position.  For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, you construct the binary number 0000010101, which translates to decimal 21. Bottle #21 was poisoned.\n\n**This method allows you to test up to 1024 (2^10) bottles with 10 prisoners in a single day.**\" \n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
