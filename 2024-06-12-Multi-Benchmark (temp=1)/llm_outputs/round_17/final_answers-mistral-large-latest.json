First, conduct two races with three horses each. The winners of these races are potential champions, but you still need to determine who is the fastest between them.\n\n2. Next, race the winners from the first two races. Now you know who the fastest horse is.\n\n3. But, there's a catch. The fastest horse could be one of the second-place horses in the first two races if the fastest horse from those races was held back by a slower horse. So, you need to race the second-place horses from the first two races.

This strategy allows you to test multiple bottles at once, and through a process of elimination, narrow down the possibilities to a single bottle. In this case, the king can leverage the concept of binary numbers to represent each bottle with a unique combination of 10 digits (0 or 1), corresponding to the 10 prisoners. If a prisoner gets a \"1\" for a particular bottle, they drink from it. After 24 hours, the king can see which prisoners have been poisoned and deduce the binary number, and hence the bottle, responsible for the poisoning. This method can identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours, making it the fastest method.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

However, in this case, we are dealing with pairs of twins.\n\nIn the context of this question, I'm assuming that the twins are not identical (in terms of having the same birthday), but are rather fraternal, meaning they could have different birthdays.\n\nThe classic birthday problem is a probability problem that can be solved using the complementary probability principle. However, since we are dealing with pairs of twins, we can think of each pair as a single entity for the purpose of this problem. This is because even if one twin from a pair shares a birthday with a twin from another pair, the condition of two people having the same birthday is met.\n\nSo, instead of dealing with individual people, we're dealing with pairs of people. This effectively halves the number of entities we need to consider.\n\nIn the classic birthday problem, the answer is approximately 23 people. But since we're dealing with pairs of twins, we would need half that number of pairs, which is 11.5 pairs.
