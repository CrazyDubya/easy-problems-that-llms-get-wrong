A straightforward approach would be to divide the bottles amongst the prisoners, but this would not be efficient. We need to think more strategically.\n\nOption B is out of the question, as it would take 24 hours to get the result, and we wouldn't know which bottle is poisoned.\n\nOption C is also not feasible, as it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is impractical and unnecessary.\n\nOption D is not a viable solution either, as the poison takes effect after 24 hours, so the prisoners wouldn't be able to taste the bitterness immediately.\n\nThat leaves us with Option A, which involves using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into two groups of 500 each.\n2. Have 1 prisoner drink from each group.\n3. Wait 24 hours and see which prisoner dies.

The problem is asking for at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday, not that two pairs of twins have the same birthday.\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n\nWith one person in the room, there's a 365\/365 = 1 chance that they have a unique birthday.\n\nWith two people in the room, there's a 364\/365 chance that the second person has a different birthday than the first person. So, there's a 1 - 364\/365 = 1\/365 chance that they share the same birthday.\n\nWith three people in the room, there's a 363\/365 chance that the third person has a different birthday than the first two. So, there's a 1 - 363\/365 chance that they share a birthday with one of the first two people.\n\nAs we add more people to the room, the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday increases. To find the number of people required for at least a 50% chance of sharing a birthday, we can use the following formula:\n\n1 - (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365) < 0.5\n\nwhere n is the number of people in the room.\n\nUsing this formula, we find that with 23 people in the room, there's a greater than 50% chance that at least two people share a birthday.\n\nSince we're asked to find the number of pairs of twins, we need to divide the total number of people by 2. However, since 23 is an odd number, we can't divide it by 2 to get an integer number of pairs. This means that we need 23 people in the room, which is equivalent to 11.5 pairs of twins (not an integer number of pairs).\n\nThe closest answer choice to 11.5 pairs is C. 23 pairs, but this is not correct since it represents the total number of people, not pairs of twins.\n\nHowever, since the options are limited, I'll choose the closest answer:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
