You cannot create a meaningful sentence without using at least one vowel more than once.\n* **Common consonants:**  Some consonants (like t, n, s, r) are incredibly common.  Avoiding repetition of these in a sentence makes it nearly impossible to construct. \n\nLet's analyze the answer choices:\n\n* **A:**  This sentence repeats vowels and several consonants.\n* **C:**  This sentence repeats the letters 'o' and 's'.\n* **D:**  This sentence repeats the letter 'e'. \n","score":""},"19":{"category":"Spatial","question":"An arrow points up.
