Initially, you have three doors to choose from, so the probability of picking the door with the gold bar behind it is 1\/3, and the probability of picking a door with rotten vegetables is 2\/3.\n\n2. After you make an initial choice (in this case, door No. 1), there are two remaining doors (door No. 2 and door No. 3). The host then offers you the option to switch to one of the remaining doors (door No. 2).\n\n3. Importantly, the host knows what is behind each door and gives you the option to switch after you pick, without revealing specific information directly but creating a logical advantage.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is realizing that the host's actions are not random and are designed to create a second decision point that actually increases your chances if you switch doors. If you stick with your initial choice (door No. 1), your probability of winning remains 1\/3. However, if you switch to the other door (door No. 2), your probability of winning increases to 2\/3 because the host's offer takes advantage of the host's knowledge of the door contents.\n\nThus, by switching doors, you maximize your chances of finding the gold bar.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the best choice is to switch to door No. 2, and the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

The key here is to leverage binary encoding to minimize the tests required.\n\nEach bottle of wine can be represented as a number from 1 to 1000. We can treat each bottle number as a 10-bit binary number (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which covers our range of 1000 bottles). Each bit in the binary representation of a bottle number can correspond to a specific prisoner. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works step-by-step:\n1. Assign each bottle a unique number from 1 to 1000.\n2. Represent each number in its 10-bit binary form.\n3. Use each bit to decide which prisoner will taste which bottle. For each bottle, if a bit in its binary representation is 1, the corresponding prisoner will taste it. Otherwise, they will not.\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners show the effects of having consumed the poison.\n5. Create the binary number based on the prisoners who were affected. The resulting binary number will match the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if bottle 789 is poisoned, the binary representation of 789 is 1100010101. Prisoners corresponding to the bits set to 1 (the 1st, 3rd, 7th, 9th, and 10th bits) will drink from that bottle. If those specific prisoners show symptoms, we can decode their combination to find out the poisoned bottle's number.\n\nThis method ensures that only one cycle of testing is needed, as it efficiently narrows down the poisoned bottle in the 1000-bottle range using just 10 prisoners.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Between 0.1m and 0.5m: This range does not make sense because to clear a 0.5m hurdle, the man must jump at least 0.5m.\n\nB. 0.5m: This is the height of the hurdle, so jumping exactly 0.5m would allow the man to just clear the hurdle.\n\nC. Slightly higher than 0.5m: This is a reasonable option because, in practice, to safely clear the hurdle, the man might need to jump a little higher than 0.5m to account for any margin of error.\n\nD. 0m: It is not possible for the man to clear a 0.5m hurdle with a 0m jump.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most accurate answer would be option C, as it reflects the practical need to jump slightly higher than the height of the hurdle to ensure clearing it. \n\nHere is the decision in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"30":{"category":"Popular science","question":"I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.
