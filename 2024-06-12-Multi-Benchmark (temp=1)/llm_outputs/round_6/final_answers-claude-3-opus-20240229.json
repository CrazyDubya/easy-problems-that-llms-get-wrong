The key insight is that by asking if you want to switch to door No. 2, the host is giving you additional information. If the gold bar was behind door No. 1 (your initial choice), the host could have offered either door No. 2 or No. 3.

Assign each bottle a unique 10-bit binary number (since there are 1000 bottles, 10 bits are needed). Have each prisoner sample the bottles corresponding to their assigned bit position - so prisoner 1 samples bottles ending in 1, prisoner 2 samples those ending in 10, prisoner 3 samples those ending in 100, etc. After 24 hours, the prisoners that sampled the poisoned bottle will have died. The binary number represented by the dead prisoners will identify the poisoned bottle's number.
