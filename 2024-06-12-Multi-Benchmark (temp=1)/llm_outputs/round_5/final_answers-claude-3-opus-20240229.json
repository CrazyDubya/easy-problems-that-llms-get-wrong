The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"Here's my analysis:\n\nA) Having all prisoners sample all 1000 bottles would require 10,000 tests, which is infeasible in 24 hours.\n\nC) Dividing the 1000 bottles among 10 prisoners would give them 100 bottles each to test. But they may end up drinking from multiple poisoned bottles and all die, leaving the poisoned bottle unidentified.\n\nD) The poison is described as bitter, but it's stated the effect (death) takes 24 hours. So tasting for bitterness wouldn't reliably identify the poison in time.\n\nB) Using a binary search strategy is optimal. Number the bottles 1 to 1000. Have prisoner 1 sample all bottles whose number has a 1 in the 1's place (1,11,21,31..991). Have prisoner 2 sample bottles with a 1 in the 10's place (10-19, 110-119, 210-219..990-999). And so on with the other prisoners up to the 1000's place.\n\nAfter 24 hours, the surviving\/dead prisoners will correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle's number. For example, if prisoners 3, 6 and 8 died, the poisoned bottle is number 01101000 in binary = 360 in decimal.\n\nThis tests only 10 prisoners and identifies the single poisoned bottle out of 1000 in 24 hours.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

If the other track is empty, pulling the lever is the most ethical choice as it saves the most lives.

There are arguments on both sides of that dilemma.\n\nWithout more information, I'll assume the other track is empty.
