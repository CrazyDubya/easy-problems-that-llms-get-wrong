If he jumps exactly 0.5m, he theoretically just touches the top of the hurdle, although in practice, a bit more height is usually necessary to ensure clearing it comfortably. Therefore, the actual minimum height he could have jumped would be slightly more than 0.5m.\n\nHence, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"30":{"category":"Popular science","question":"I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.
