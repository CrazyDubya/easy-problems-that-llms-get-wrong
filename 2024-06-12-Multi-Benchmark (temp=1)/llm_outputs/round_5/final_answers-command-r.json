Binary searching is efficient as it significantly reduces the number of tests required, especially when dealing with a large number of items.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n\nThere are 365 days in a year, so the probability of two people having the same birthday is 1\/365. With two people in a room, the chance that they have the same birthday is 1\/365 * 1\/364 = 1\/133,060.\n\nTo get to a 50% chance, we can use the formula for compound probability:\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)\n\nWe can interpret \"two people having the same birthday\" as event A and \"entering the room\" as event B. Then, starting with 50%:\n0.5 = P(A and B)\n= P(A) * P(B|A)\n<= (1\/365) * P(B|A)\n\nSolving for P(B|A), we get:\nP(B|A) >= 365\/2 = 182.5\n\nNow consider the probability that two pairs of twins (four people) would enter the room. Assuming all birthdays are equally likely, the probability that two of them have the same birthday is 182.5\/365^2, which is significantly higher than 50%.\n\nUsing the compound probability formula again, with A being \"two pairs of twins enter the room\" and B being the same birthday event, and knowing that P(A) = 1\/15625 (assuming an discrete infinite number of people in the world), we get:\n\n0.5 = P(A) * P(B|A) >= (1\/15625) * 182.5\/365^2\n\nFrom here, we can solve for P(B|A) = 12\/365 ~= 1\/30. This means that we need 12 pairs of twins in the room to have at least a 50% chance of finding two people with the same birthday.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Fill the 5-gallon jug and pour its contents into the 4-gallon jug. Now we have one jug with 5 gallons and another with 4 gallons.\n\n2. Next, carefully transfer the 4 gallons from the 4-gallon jug into the 3-gallon jug. This might involve some back-and-forth pouring between the two jugs until the 3-gallon jug is filled exactly to the 4-gallon mark.\n\n3. You now have 1 gallon of water remaining in the 4-gallon jug. Pour this into the 3-gallon jug, which already has 4 gallons, giving you a total of 5 gallons in the 3-gallon jug.\n\n4. Finally, using the 5-gallon jug, scoop out 1 gallon of water and transfer it into the 4-gallon jug, leaving you with exactly 4 gallons in the 4-gallon jug.\n\nThis process ensures you have the desired 4 gallons of water without any wasted efforts or unnecessary jug fillings.","score":""},"28":{"category":"Popular science","question":"A 2kg tree grows in a planted pot with 10kg of soil.
