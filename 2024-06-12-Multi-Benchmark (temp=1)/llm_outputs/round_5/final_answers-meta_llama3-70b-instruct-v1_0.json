With six horses, we would need 6C2 = 15 comparisons if we were to compare each horse with every other horse individually. However, we can optimize this process by using a knockout-style tournament.\n\nIn the first race, we can race three horses and eliminate the slowest one. This will leave us with five horses. In the second race, we can race three of the remaining horses and eliminate the slowest one again. This will leave us with four horses. We can continue this process until we have only two horses left, and then we can race them to find the fastest horse.\n\nUsing this approach, we can find the fastest horse in a minimum of five races.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"A classic problem!\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nWe want to find the minimum number of pairs of twins needed in a room so that there's at least a 50% chance that two people share the same birthday.\n\nFirst, let's consider a single pair of twins. The probability that they share the same birthday is 1 (certainty), since they're twins!\n\nNow, let's add more pairs of twins. We want to find the number of pairs such that the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday is at least 50%.\n\nIntuitively, we can think of it like this: as we add more pairs of twins, the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday increases. We can model this using the complementary probability, which is the probability that no two people share the same birthday.\n\nAssuming each pair of twins has a unique birthday (which is a reasonable assumption, since there are 365 possible birthdays), we can calculate the probability that no two people share the same birthday as:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365 - n + 1)\/365)\n\nwhere n is the total number of people in the room (which is twice the number of pairs of twins).\n\nTo find the number of pairs of twins needed for at least a 50% chance of two people sharing the same birthday, we need to find the smallest n such that the probability of no two people sharing the same birthday is less than or equal to 50%. This is equivalent to finding the smallest n such that:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365 - n + 1)\/365) \u2264 0.5\n\nUsing a calculator or computer, we find that this inequality is satisfied when n \u2265 46.

This means that there is no such thing as a \"last room\" or a \"full\" hotel.\n\nAt first glance, answer A seems intuitive - just put the guest in an empty room. However, this answer doesn't take into account the fact that the hotel has an infinite number of rooms. If we simply put the guest in an empty room, we're not utilizing the existing rooms in any way.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the hotel can indeed accommodate one more guest, despite having an infinite number of rooms.\n\nAnswer C is also incorrect because it's impractical and unnecessary to ask each current guest to move to the next room. This would cause a lot of inconvenience and wouldn't be a efficient way to accommodate the new guest.\n\nAnswer D, on the other hand, is a clever solution. By asking each current guest to move to the room number n*2, we're effectively freeing up all the odd-numbered rooms. Since there are an infinite number of rooms, this will always result in an empty room (room 1) that we can put the new guest in.
