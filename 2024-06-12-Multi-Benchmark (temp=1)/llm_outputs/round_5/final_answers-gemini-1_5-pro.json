What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"```json\n{\n\"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n\"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is B and how it works:\n\n* **A is incorrect** -  This would kill all the prisoners and is incredibly inhumane!\n* **C is incorrect** - This doesn't account for the time delay of the poison.  The prisoners wouldn't die immediately after sipping.\n* **D is incorrect** -  The poison is described as very bitter, but the prompt doesn't state it alters the taste of the wine itself. \n\n**Solution Explanation (Binary Search):**\n\n1. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n2. **Number the Bottles:**  Imagine each bottle is numbered from 1 to 1000.  Convert these numbers to their binary representation (e.g., bottle 1 is 0000000001, bottle 2 is 0000000010, bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.)\n3. **Assign Wine Based on Binary:** Each prisoner will drink from bottles based on their corresponding binary digit.  \n    * For example: Prisoner 1 drinks from every bottle where the *last* binary digit is a '1'. Prisoner 2 drinks from every bottle where the *second to last* binary digit is a '1', and so on.\n4. **Observe After 24 Hours:**  Note which prisoners die. This creates a binary code. For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary code is 0011000001.\n5. **Convert to Decimal:** Convert the resulting binary code back to a decimal number. This decimal number represents the poisoned bottle.\n\n**Why Binary Search Works:**  Binary search is incredibly efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles. This method guarantees finding the poisoned bottle within the 24-hour time limit. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
