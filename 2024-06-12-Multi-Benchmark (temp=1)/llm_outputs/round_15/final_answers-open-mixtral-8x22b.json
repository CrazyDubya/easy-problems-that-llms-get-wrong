Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n\nExplanation:\nThe fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle would involve a binary search strategy, which is a quick search algorithm that works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. In this scenario, the king can number the bottles of wine from 0 to 999, and then assign a specific subset of bottles to each prisoner using a binary approach. Each prisoner will consume a sample from these bottles and wait for 24 hours. Since there are 10 prisoners, they can go through 1024 (2^10) bottles, making it possible to test all 1000 bottles of wine.\n\nOnce the 24 hours are up, the king will know the poison's location by finding the prisoner who had consumed the poison and checking which bottle within their assigned subset had the highest index. By knowing which prisoners remained alive and which ones did not, one can identify the poisoned bottle by taking the binary representation of its index and selecting the binary digits that correspond to live prisoners as '0' while dead prisoners as '1'.\n\nOption A is unrealistic as the poison is not distinguishable by taste. Option C and D are inhumane and involve risking prisoners' lives, which is both unethical and unrealistic. Therefore, the binary search strategy in Option B is the best, most efficient, and ethical method to solve this problem.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"The question you're asking seems to be a variation of the classic Birthday Paradox problem, but with a specific focus on pairs of twins. The Birthday Paradox states that in a group of 23 randomly chosen people, there's approximately a 50% chance that some pair of them will share the same birthday. However, this problem involves twins, so we need to adjust our approach.\n\nSince we're dealing with pairs of twins, each pair essentially counts as 2 people with the same birthday. So, we don't need as many pairs of twins to reach a 50% chance of having two people with the same birthday as we would with random individuals.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- 1 pair of twins: This is a certainty, as twins by definition share the same birthday.\n- 2 pairs of twins: There are two possible scenarios: all twins have different birthdays or the two sets of twins share a birthday. The probability of each twin pair having a different birthday is (364\/365)^2 (assuming a non-leap year and uniform distribution of birthdays). For two twin pairs, this becomes (364\/365)^4, so the probability of at least two twins sharing a birthday is 1 - (364\/365)^4, which is less than 0.5.\n- 3 pairs of twins: Following the same logic, the probability becomes 1 - (364\/365)^6, which is still less than 0.5.\n- And so on...\n\nAs we increase the number of twin pairs, the probability of having at least two pairs with the same birthday increases. However, the exact number of twin pairs needed to reach a 50% chance would require more detailed calculations or simulations, and it might not be an integer number of pairs.\n\nBut based on the given options, the closest answer to the question \"How many pairs of twins do you need in a room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday?\" would be option A. 12 pairs. Even though the probability will still be less than 50%, it's the best option given the choices.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"A\"\n}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
