This allows you to test multiple bottles on each prisoner.\n\nIf you simply divide the 1000 bottles among the 10 prisoners, as suggested in answers A and C, you would only be able to test 10 bottles total, which is not enough.\n\nAnswer D suggests having all prisoners sample all 1000 bottles, which would definitely kill all the prisoners and not isolate which specific bottle is poisoned.\n\nThe most efficient approach is to use a binary search strategy, as described in answer B. Assign each bottle a unique 10-digit binary number, where each digit maps to a specific prisoner. For example, bottle 0000000001 is only sampled by prisoner 10, bottle 0000000010 is only sampled by prisoner 9, bottle 0000000011 is sampled by prisoners 9 and 10, and so on.\n\nHave each prisoner sample the bottles corresponding to their assigned binary digit. After 24 hours, the prisoners that sampled the poisoned bottle will have died. The binary number represented by the dead prisoners will reveal the bottle number of the poisoned wine.\n\nThis allows you to uniquely identify the poisoned bottle out of 1000 total bottles using only 10 prisoners, and get the result within the 24 hour time limit.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
