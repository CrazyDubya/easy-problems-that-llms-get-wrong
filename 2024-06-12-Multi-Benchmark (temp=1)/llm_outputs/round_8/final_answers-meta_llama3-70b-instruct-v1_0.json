The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption, which means that the king can't afford to wait for multiple iterations of testing.\n\nOption A is not efficient, as it would require each prisoner to test 100 bottles of wine, which would be time-consuming and may not even yield a result in 24 hours.\n\nOption C is not feasible, as getting all prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine would be impractical and may not identify the poisoned bottle in 24 hours.\n\nOption D is incorrect, as the poison is bitter, but the prisoners may not be able to taste the bitterness immediately.\n\nOption B is the correct answer. By using a binary search strategy, the king can leverage the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.

However, the key to this problem is to realize that we're not asking about the probability of two specific people having the same birthday, but rather the probability that at least two people out of the group have the same birthday.\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are evenly distributed across 365 days (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n\nFor a single pair of twins, the probability that they have different birthdays is 364\/365, since there are 364 other days for the second twin's birthday to fall on.\n\nNow, let's consider a group of people, and imagine we add them one by one. For each additional person, the probability that they don't match any of the previous birthdays is (365 - k)\/365, where k is the number of people already in the room.\n\nUsing this logic, we can calculate the probability that all people in the room have different birthdays:\n\nP(all different) = (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365 - k + 1)\/365)\n\nTo find the smallest number of people (or pairs of twins) needed for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday, we can set up an equation:\n\nP(at least two share a birthday) \u2265 0.5\n1 - P(all different) \u2265 0.5\n\nSolving this equation, we find that we need at least 23 people (or 23 pairs of twins) in the room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

At first glance, it appears to be a simple question about accommodating one more guest in a hotel with an infinite number of rooms. However, the correct answer is not as straightforward as it seems.\n\nThe key to this puzzle is the phrase \"partially full hotel.\" This implies that there are already some guests occupying some of the rooms. The question is how to accommodate one more guest.\n\nOption B, \"By putting the guest in an empty room,\" might seem like a reasonable answer at first. However, the puzzle states that the hotel has an infinite number of rooms, which means that there are always going to be empty rooms available. But the question is not asking about finding an empty room; it's asking how to accommodate one more guest given the current state of the hotel.\n\nOption C, \"You cannot accommodate one more guest,\" is also incorrect. The puzzle explicitly states that the hotel has an infinite number of rooms, which means that it can always accommodate one more guest.\n\nOptions A and D are similar in that they both involve moving existing guests to different rooms. However, option A, \"You ask each current guest to move to the next room,\" is not a good solution because it would displace the guest currently occupying the next room, and so on. This would create a cascade of room changes, but it would not provide a solution for accommodating the new guest.\n\nOn the other hand, option D, \"You ask each current guest to move to the room number n*2,\" is a clever solution. If each current guest moves to the room with a number twice their current room number, this would free up all the odd-numbered rooms. Since there are an infinite number of rooms, there are also an infinite number of odd-numbered rooms, which means that there would always be at least one empty odd-numbered room available to accommodate the new guest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"26":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A runaway trolley is heading down the tracks away from five people upwards of the track.

I walk to my friend's house at an average speed of 3mph. This means the time it takes to walk to my friend's house is the distance divided by 3mph.\n2. To double my average speed for the entire trip, I need to make the total time for the round trip (walking to my friend's house and running back) equal to half the time it took to walk to my friend's house.\n3.

Since the total time for the round trip is equal to the time it takes to walk to my friend's house plus the time it takes to run back, we can set up the equation: t + (time to run back) = 2t\/2 = t\n6.
