To determine the probability that two people in a room share a birthday, we can use the formula for combinations: C(n, r), which counts the ways r elements can be chosen from a set of n elements. \n\nIn this case, for each additional pair of twins, the probability increases. Starting with one pair, the probability of a shared birthday is 1\/366. With two pairs, the chances are 2\/366 + 1\/366 = 3\/366. As we can't have half a person in a room, we'll need enough pairs to get above 50%.\n\nUsing the combination formula, for 12 pairs of twins, the probability is:\n> C(366, 2) x (12\/366) x (11\/365) = 0.5003, \n\nwhich rounds up to 50% or over.
