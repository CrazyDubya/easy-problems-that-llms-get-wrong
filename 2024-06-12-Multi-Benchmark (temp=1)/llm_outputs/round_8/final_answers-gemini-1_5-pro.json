Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the correct answer is **B** and an explanation of the strategy:\n\n* **The Goal:** Identify the single poisoned bottle out of 1000 within 24 hours.\n\n* **Why A, C, and D are incorrect:**\n    * **A & C:**  These methods are inhumane and inefficient. They also don't guarantee finding the poisoned bottle if multiple prisoners drink from it (A) or if the poison is tasteless (D).\n    * **D:**  The question states the poison is bitter, implying it might be detectable by taste. However, relying solely on taste is risky and could lead to accidental poisoning.\n\n* **Why B is correct (Binary Search):**\n\n    1. **Numbering:** Imagine each prisoner represents a digit in a binary number. With 10 prisoners, you can represent numbers from 0 to 1023 (2^10 = 1024).\n\n    2. **Labeling:** Assign each bottle a number from 1 to 1000.\n\n    3. **Binary Representation:** Convert each bottle's number into its binary equivalent (e.g., bottle 1 is 0000000001, bottle 2 is 0000000010, bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.).\n\n    4. **Prisoner Assignment:** Each prisoner is assigned a specific digit position in the binary number (e.g., Prisoner 1 represents the rightmost digit, Prisoner 2 the next, and so on).\n\n    5. **Wine Sampling:**  A prisoner drinks from a bottle only if the bottle's binary representation has a '1' in the digit position the prisoner represents. For example:\n        * Prisoner 1 (rightmost digit) drinks from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7...\n        * Prisoner 2 (second digit from the right) drinks from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7...\n\n    6. **Decoding the Result:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die. The binary representation of the poisoned bottle is formed by noting which prisoners died. A '1' represents a dead prisoner, and a '0' represents a living prisoner. \n\n* **Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0010000001, which converts to the decimal number 513. Therefore, bottle number 513 was poisoned.\n\n* **Efficiency:**  This method guarantees finding the poisoned bottle with the fewest deaths possible. In the worst-case scenario, 10 prisoners could identify the poisoned bottle out of 1023. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
