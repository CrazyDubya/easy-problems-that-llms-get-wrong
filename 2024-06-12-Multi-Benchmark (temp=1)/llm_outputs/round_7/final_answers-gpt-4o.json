The host then gives you a choice to switch to Door No. 2.\n\nIt's important to remember that the host knows what's behind each door and will always offer you a door that does not contain the gold bar. The Monty Hall problem teaches us that switching doors increases your probability of winning. \n\nHere's the logic behind it:\n\n- When you initially pick Door No. 1, the probability of the gold bar being behind it is 1\/3.\n- The probability of the gold bar being behind either Door No. 2 or Door No. 3 is 2\/3.\n- By asking you to switch to Door No. 2, the host effectively informs you that Door No. 3 does not have the gold bar (assuming typical Monty Hall rules where one losing door is revealed).\n\nTherefore, if you switch to Door No. 2, you are moving to a door that initially had a 2\/3 chance of concealing the gold bar. This means that your chances of winning improve if you switch.\n\nHence, the best choice to maximize your probability of winning is to switch to Door No. 2.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"ANSWER\": \"C\"\n}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Your opponent has already fired once, and no bullet came out. This means that the current chamber must be the empty one, as otherwise, your opponent would have fired a bullet.\n\nIf you don't spin the chamber again, the next chamber you fire will certainly contain one of the five bullets, because the gun chambers cycle sequentially. Thus, if you do not spin, the probability of firing a bullet is 5 out of 5, which is 100%.\n\n### Scenario With Spinning Again\nIf you do spin the chambers again, each of the six chambers has an equal probability of coming up next. Since there is still only one empty chamber among the six and five loaded ones, the probability of firing a bullet if you spin the chambers is 5 out of 6, or approximately 83.33%.\n\n### Analysis\nBy comparing the two scenarios:\n- Not spinning: 100% chance of firing a bullet.\n- Spinning: 83.33% chance of firing a bullet.\n\nTherefore, you should spin the chambers again to reduce your probability of firing a bullet.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"C\"\n}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), this means we can create unique combinations to represent all the 1000 bottles with the 10 prisoners. By assigning each bottle a unique binary number from 1 to 1000, we can have each prisoner drink from the bottles according to the binary representation. For example, if bottle 1 is represented as 0000000001 in binary, then only the prisoner corresponding to the last bit will drink from it. If bottle 2 is 0000000010, then only the second to last prisoner will drink from it. If bottle 3 is 0000000011, then both of the last two prisoners will drink from it, and so on.\n\nHere's how the process works:\n1. Assign each of the 1000 bottles a number from 1 to 1000.\n2. Convert each number to a binary form.\n3. Have each prisoner drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is a 1.\n4. After 24 hours, note which prisoners are dead. Their positions in the binary numbering give the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nIn this method, the king will be able to find the exact poisoned bottle in 24 hours by observing which prisoners have died.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

In the traditional birthday problem, it takes 23 people to have a better than even chance (50%) that at least two people share the same birthday.\n\nIn the case of twins, each pair of twins has the same birthday. Therefore, if we're considering 23 pairs of twins, we're effectively considering 46 individuals who may share a birthday, as each twin pair counts twice towards birthday matches.\n\nLet's calculate the probability of no shared birthdays out of 46 individuals and check if that's the threshold we're looking for:\n\nThe general approach for the classic birthday problem is as follows:\n- For \\( n \\) people, the probability of no shared birthday is:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{no match}) = \\frac{365}{365} \\times \\frac{364}{365} \\times \\frac{363}{365} \\times \\ldots \\times \\frac{365 - (n - 1)}{365} \\]\n\n- For \\( n \\) = 46 (since each twin pair counts as two):\n\n\\[ P(\\text{no match}) = \\frac{365}{365} \\times \\frac{364}{365} \\times \\frac{363}{365} \\times \\ldots \\times \\frac{320}{365} \\]\n\nIf the probability of no shared birthday drops below 0.5, it means the probability of at least one shared birthday is above 0.5, or 50%.\n\nGiven that the traditional birthday problem result (23 people) is widely known to correlate with around a 50% threshold, we infer that it would be the same for 23 pairs of twins:\n\nTherefore, the number of pairs of twins needed = 23 pairs.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"Let's break down the problem to understand it better.\n\nFirstly, let's denote the distance to your friend's house as \\(d\\) miles. \n\nWhen you walk to your friend's house, you average 3 mph. So, the time it takes to get to your friend's house is:\n\n\\[ t_{\\text{walk}} = \\frac{d}{3} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nNow, we want to find the required running speed \\(v\\) on the way back such that the average speed for the entire trip (to and from the friend's house) is doubled.\n\nTo calculate the average speed for the entire trip, we need to consider the total distance and the total time for the trip.\n\nThe total distance for the round trip is \\(2d\\) miles.\n\nThe total time for the entire trip is the sum of the time walking to the friend's house and the time running back:\n\n\\[ t_{\\text{total}} = t_{\\text{walk}} + t_{\\text{run}} = \\frac{d}{3} + \\frac{d}{v} \\]\n\nWe want the average speed for the whole trip to be twice the original average speed to the friend's house. The original average speed was 3 mph, so twice that is 6 mph.\n\n\\[ \\text{desired average speed} = 6 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nThe formula for average speed is:\n\n\\[ \\text{average speed} = \\frac{\\text{total distance}}{\\text{total time}} \\]\n\nSubstituting in the desired values:\n\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{3} + \\frac{d}{v}} \\]\n\nNow we solve for \\(v\\):\n\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{3} + \\frac{d}{v}} \\]\n\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{2d}{d \\left( \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{v} \\right)} \\]\n\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{2d}{d \\left( \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{v} \\right)} \\]\n\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{v}} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{2}{6} \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nSince it leads to \\(\\frac{1}{v} = 0\\), it means \\(v\\) needs to be infinitely large.\n\nThus, the answer is: \n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""}}
