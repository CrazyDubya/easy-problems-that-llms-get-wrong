We want to find the minimum number of pairs of twins (i.e., people) needed in a room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n2. Assume each person's birthday is independent and uniformly distributed across 365 possible days (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n3. For a single pair of twins, the probability that they share the same birthday is 1\/365, since there's only one way for them to share a birthday out of 365 possible days.\n4. Now, let's consider the probability that two people out of a group of n people (not necessarily twins) share the same birthday. We can use the complementary probability, i.e., the probability that no two people share the same birthday.\n5. For n people, the probability that person 1 has a unique birthday is 365\/365 = 1. The probability that person 2 has a unique birthday (different from person 1) is 364\/365. The probability that person 3 has a unique birthday (different from persons 1 and 2) is 363\/365, and so on.\n6. The probability that all n people have unique birthdays is the product of these probabilities: (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365).\n7. We want to find the smallest n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%. This means the probability of all n people having unique birthdays should be less than or equal to 50%.\n8. Using a calculator or software to compute the probability, we find that when n = 23, the probability of all people having unique birthdays is approximately 49.3%.
