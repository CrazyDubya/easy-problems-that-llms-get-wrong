We have six horses, so by racing two horses at a time, we can determine the faster of the two in a single race.

With 1 pair of twins, the likelihood of them having the same birthday is 1\/365. To get to a 50% chance, we'd need to double this probability, so 2\/365. \n\nAssuming each twin has an equal chance of being born on any day of the year, the probability of two different twins in the room having the same birthday is independent of each other. We can therefore multiply the probability of one pair having a matching birthday by the number of pairs present. If we have 12 pairs, then 2\/365 * 12 = 1\/15, which is greater than 0.5.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
