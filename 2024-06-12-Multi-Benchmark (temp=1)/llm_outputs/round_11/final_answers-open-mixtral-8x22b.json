Finally, makes one more left turn and walks 1km.\n\nSince he's taking 90-degree left turns at every kilometer, his path forms a square with points A, B, and C being three corners and the last point being the fourth corner (let's call it point D).

Here's the reasoning behind this:\n\nWe know that one guardian always tells the truth and the other always lies. We also know that the truth-teller is guarding the door leading to certain death, while the liar is guarding the door leading to freedom.\n\nTo ensure we find the safe door, we can approach one guardian and ask about what the other guardian would say if we asked them which door leads to freedom.\n\nIf we ask the question to the truth-teller, they would tell us that the liar (who is guarding the safe door) will say that their door leads to freedom (which would be a lie as per their nature).\n\nOn the other hand, if we ask the question to the liar, they would say that the truth-teller (who is guarding the death door) will claim that their door leads to freedom, which is contradictory to the actual answer.\n\nIn both cases, the answer would indicate the door guarded by the liar as the safe passage, which means we just need to ask one question to know which door leads to freedom.\n\nSo the answer, in JSON format, would be:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's why:\nIn this scenario, the king has 1000 bottles of wine and 10 prisoners to help him. If each prisoner tastes one bottle, that would only allow for identifying 10 bottles at most, which is not sufficient. The king needs to use a more efficient method to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours.\n\nBinary search is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can be used to minimize the number of tests needed. In this case, the king can assign each prisoner a unique identifier (000 to 101 in binary), which represents the prisoners' order in the binary search.\n\nTo start, the first prisoner samples the wine from the bottle with a binary identifier of \"000\" (1st bottle). The second prisoner samples the wine from the bottle with a binary identifier of \"100\" (513th bottle). Both of them will wait for 24 hours to see if the poison takes effect.\n\n- If the first prisoner dies, the poison is in one of the first 512 bottles. If he lives, it's in one of the latter 488 bottles.\n- Similarly, if the second prisoner dies, the poison is in one of the bottles numbered between 513-768. If he lives, it's in one of the bottles numbered between 769-1000.\n\nUsing this information, the king can narrow down the pool of possible poisoned bottles strategically, minimizing the number of tests needed for the remaining prisoners in subsequent rounds. By using the binary search method, the king can efficiently determine the poisoned bottle in no more than 10 rounds with each prisoner taking a single test per round, ensuring results are available within the 24-hour time constraint.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

However, the birthday paradox is about the probability of two people sharing the same birthday in a group of a certain size. The presence of twins affects this probability, as each pair of twins is guaranteed to share a birthday.\n\nNow let's consider the scenario: if there's only one pair of twins, then technically, there's already a 100% chance that two people share a birthday (since there are only the twins). However, let's take the question to mean the probability of two non-twins sharing a birthday. In this case, we can still use the birthday paradox logic. We need to find out when there is a 50% chance that two random people (excluding twins) share the same birthday. This occurs around 23 people (not pairs!), according to the birthday paradox. However, since we are dealing with pairs of twins, and one twin is guaranteed to share a birthday with the other twin, the number of random people to reach a 50% chance of a shared birthday is not 23.\n\nNow let's break it down:\n\n- The first pair of twins adds 2 people, with a guaranteed match.\n- We need 21 additional non-twins to reach 23 total people, which gives us about a 50% chance of having another shared birthday.\n- This results in 11 total pairs (1 pair of twins plus 10 other pairs, each with one parent), not 23 pairs, to have a 50% probability of two non-twins sharing a birthday.\n\nSince the question provides limited choices that don't match this scenario, the closest answer to providing at least a 50% chance of two people (excluding twin pairs) sharing a birthday is:\n\nB. 12 pairs\n\nHowever, keep in mind that this is still a rough estimate and not an exact answer, as the birthday paradox is a probabilistic scenario.\n\nBased on the logic provided:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
