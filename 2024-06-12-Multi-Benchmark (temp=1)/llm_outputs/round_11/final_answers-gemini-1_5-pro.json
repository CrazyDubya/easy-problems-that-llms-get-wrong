The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nC. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nD.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"```json\n{\n\"ANSWER\": \"C\",\n\"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is C and an explanation of how it works:\n\n**Why A, B, and D are incorrect:**\n\n* **A:** This is impossible and impractical. Each prisoner would need to drink from 1000 bottles! \n* **B:** The poison is specifically described as bitter, implying it's tasteless and undetectable before it takes effect.\n* **D:** Similar to A, this would likely kill all the prisoners as they wouldn't know which bottle was poisoned until it's too late.\n\n**Why C is correct: Binary Search Strategy**\n\n1. **Number the bottles:** Assign each wine bottle a number from 1 to 1000.\n2. **Number the prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n3. **Binary representation:** Think of each prisoner representing a place value in a binary number (e.g., prisoner 1 is the 'ones' place, prisoner 2 is the 'twos' place, prisoner 3 is the 'fours' place, and so on).\n4. **Wine assignment:** Each prisoner will drink from specific bottles based on their binary representation. For example:\n   * Prisoner 1 drinks from bottles where the bottle number has a '1' in the ones place of its binary representation.\n   * Prisoner 2 drinks from bottles where the bottle number has a '1' in the twos place of its binary representation. \n   * ...and so on.\n5. **After 24 hours:**  Observe which prisoners die. The dead prisoners represent '1' bits, and the living prisoners represent '0' bits. Construct a binary number based on this. This binary number directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIf prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 010001 (Prisoner 5, 4, 3, 2, 1), which translates to the decimal number 17. Therefore, bottle number 17 is poisoned.\n\n**Efficiency:**  Binary search is extremely efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles in a single iteration. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is due to the way probabilities combine as we add more people to the room.\n* **Twins Influence:** While twins guarantee a shared birthday *within* a pair, they don't drastically change the overall probability across the entire room as quickly as the standard birthday paradox does. \n\nTherefore, we need a number of twin pairs close to the original 23 to reach that 50% probability.
