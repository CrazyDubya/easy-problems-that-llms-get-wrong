Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy. This strategy allows him to test multiple bottles at once, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Each prisoner can be thought of as a bit in a binary number, where a value of 1 indicates they were given a sip of wine from a particular set of bottles, and 0 indicates they were not. By carefully assigning sets of bottles to each prisoner, the king can identify the poisoned bottle in just one day, as the poison takes exactly 24 hours to take effect.\n\nFor this problem, the king can assign bottles to the 10 prisoners in the following manner:\nPrisoner 1 drinks from bottles numbered 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, and 1023. (Powers of 2 minus 1)\nPrisoner 2 drinks from bottles numbered 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 15, 30, 31, 62, 63, ..., 1022, and 1023. (Multiples of 2)\nPrisoner 3 drinks from bottles numbered 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 28, 29, ..., 1020, 1021, 1022, and 1023. (Multiples of 4)\n...\nPrisoner 10 drinks from the last 10 bottles (991 to 1000).\n\nBy doing so, each bottle is assigned a unique binary code, and by observing which prisoners die, the king can decode the number of the poisoned bottle. Since there are 10 prisoners, this method can be used to test up to 1023 bottles (2^10 - 1).\n\nThe answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
