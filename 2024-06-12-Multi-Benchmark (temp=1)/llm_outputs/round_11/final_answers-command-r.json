The group would need to send the fastest person, A, across the bridge first, taking 1 minute. Then, B would need to start crossing immediately after, taking 2 minutes. After B begins, A and the slowest person, D, would need to turn back and recall the other person, C, who takes 5 minutes to cross. This cumulative time of 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 minutes. Finally, the whole group would need to cross together, which would take the 10 minutes of the slowest person, D.
