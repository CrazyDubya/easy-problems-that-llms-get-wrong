Initially, the probability of a bullet being fired is 5\/6. Since your opponent spun the chambers and fired but no bullet came out, you know that the chamber he fired was empty.\n\n### Case 1: Not Spinning\nIf you do not spin again, there is only one empty chamber left out of the original six chambers. Since the empty chamber was just fired and the cylinder advances to the next chamber in sequence, there are 5 possible chambers remaining, of which 4 contain bullets. Hence, the probability of firing a live round now is 4\/5 or 80%.\n\n### Case 2: Spinning Again\nIf you spin the chambers again, you're back at the original probability where each chamber has an equal chance of being fired. There are five bullets out of six chambers, so the probability remains 5\/6 or approximately 83.33%.\n\n### Comparison\n- Not spinning: 4\/5 (80%) chance of firing a bullet at yourself.\n- Spinning: 5\/6 (approximately 83.33%) chance of firing a bullet at yourself.\n\nSince not spinning the chamber results in a lower probability (80%) compared to spinning (83.33%), you should choose to not spin the chamber again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Therefore, the truth-telling guardian will point to the death door as the lying guardian's answer.\n- If you ask the lying guardian, they would lie about what the truth-telling guardian would say. The truth-telling guardian would indicate the death door as the correct door (since it is opposite), but the lying guardian will falsely indicate the freedom door because they always lie.\n\nIn both cases, the indicated door will be the death door.

Number the bottles from 1 to 1000.\n2. Convert the bottle numbers to a 10-bit binary representation because 10 prisoners can represent up to \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) combinations, which is more than enough for 1000 bottles.\n3. Each bit in the binary representation of the bottle number will correspond to whether a prisoner drinks from that bottle.\n4. If a bit is 1, the corresponding prisoner will take a sip from that bottle. If the bit is 0, they will not.\n5. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners are affected by the poison. The combination of affected prisoners (represented by 1) and non-affected prisoners (represented by 0) will point to the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example:\n- Bottle 1 is 0000000001 in binary. Only prisoner 1 drinks from it.\n- Bottle 2 is 0000000010. Only prisoner 2 drinks from it.\n- Bottle 3 is 0000000011.

As a result, the tree's growth does not equate to a direct one-to-one decrease in the soil mass.\n\nGiven that the tree initially weighs 2kg and grows to 3kg, it gains 1kg in mass. This 1kg increase does not come solely from the soil; much of it comes from CO\u2082 and water. The assumption is that the mass of the soil in the pot remains relatively unchanged. Therefore, the amount of soil left should still be approximately 10kg.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct choice is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"29":{"category":"Relational","question":"A man steps over a 0.5m hurdle.

This is due to the fact that his entire body, particularly his feet, must clear the top of the hurdle without making contact. Therefore, the minimum height he could have jumped must be slightly higher than 0.5m to ensure he clears the hurdle.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. 0m - This is not possible because 0m means no jump at all.\nB. Between 0.1m and 0.5m - This range is insufficient to clear a 0.5m hurdle.\nC. Slightly higher than 0.5m - This would be the correct answer as it accounts for clearing the hurdle.\nD. 0.5m - This is exactly the height of the hurdle, but practically, he needs slightly more to actually clear it.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"30":{"category":"Popular science","question":"I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.
