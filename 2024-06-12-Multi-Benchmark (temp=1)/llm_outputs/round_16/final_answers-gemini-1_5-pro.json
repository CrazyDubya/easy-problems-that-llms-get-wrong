The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's the breakdown of why the answer is B and why the others are incorrect:\n\n* **A is incorrect** because the poison takes 24 hours to take effect. Tasting it wouldn't give immediate results.\n* **C is incorrect**  because it's needlessly cruel and inefficient.  You would kill all the prisoners to find one bottle.\n* **D is incorrect** because, like A, the poison's delayed effect makes this strategy useless.\n\n**B is correct** because it leverages the power of binary search in a clever way:\n\n1. **Numbering:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10. \n2. **Binary Representation:**  Think of each prisoner as representing a place value in a binary number (e.g., prisoner 1 is the 'ones' place, prisoner 2 is the 'twos' place, prisoner 3 is the 'fours' place, and so on).\n3. **Wine Sampling:** Each bottle of wine is also given a number from 1 to 1000.  A prisoner drinks from a bottle if the bottle's number, when converted to binary, has a '1' in the place value the prisoner represents. For example:\n    * Bottle 5 (binary 0000000101): Prisoners 1 and 3 would drink from this bottle.\n    * Bottle 8 (binary 0000001000): Only Prisoner 4 would drink from this bottle.\n4. **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank the poisoned wine will die.  The binary representation of the poisoned bottle number is determined by noting which prisoners died. For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0000010101, which translates to 85 \u2013 bottle number 85 was poisoned.\n\n**This method is the fastest because it allows you to test a large number of possibilities with a small number of 'tests' (prisoners).** In just one round, you can narrow down the poisoned bottle out of 1000.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is because we're looking at the probability of *any* two people sharing a birthday, not just one specific person.\n* **Twins and the Problem:**  While having twins guarantees at least two people share a birthday, it doesn't change the underlying probability for the rest of the people in the room.\n* **Finding the Threshold:** We still need to apply the logic of the birthday paradox. To surpass a 50% chance of any two people (including the twins, but not limited to them) sharing a birthday, we need approximately 23 people. Since each pair of twins contributes 2 people, we need about half that number in twin pairs. \n\nTherefore, 23 pairs of twins, or 46 people, will give us a greater than 50% chance of any two people in the room sharing a birthday.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
