Initially, there are five bullets in the six-chambers revolver, making the probability of not getting a bullet when the trigger is pulled equal to 1\/6. Since no bullet came out when your opponent pulled the trigger, this means that he landed on an empty chamber. From this information, we can deduce that the remaining chambers contain all the bullets (5 bullets in 5 remaining chambers). Therefore, spinning the chambers would not change the probability of pulling the trigger and hitting a bullet, as it is guaranteed that there are bullets in the next 5 consecutive chambers.\n\nSo, it is not necessary to spin the chambers again. In fact, not spinning the chambers would preserve the empty chamber your opponent landed on, thus giving a 1\/6 chance of survival, whereas spinning the chambers would remove that chance entirely.","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

This means that a pound of water, a pound of feathers, and a pound of any other substance would all weigh the same - that is, one pound. The misconception arises due to differences in volume, as a pound of one substance can take up less or more space than a pound of another substance.\n\nIn this case, however, the options list three pounds of air as one of the choices. As air is much less dense than water, feathers, or bricks, it takes up a larger volume to reach the same weight as a pound.

Therefore, the correct answer is that two pounds of bricks weigh more than a pound of water, a pound of feathers, and three pounds of air.\n\nNote that while a pound of feathers is equal in weight to a pound of water or a pound of any other substance, the question asked which option weighed more, not which option weighed the same.

Each prisoner drinks from their respective group. The prisoner who dies within 24 hours indicates the group where the poisoned wine is located.\n\nNext, repeat the process with the group identified to narrow down the search, further dividing the bottles into smaller groups. Continue this process until only one bottle is left.

So we want S to be 2W. To find the average speed, we add the walking time and running time (T + D) and divide by the distance (3D, which is constant).\n\nS = (3D) \/ (T + D) = 2W\n\nNow, express T in terms of R, D, and W from the first equation:\n\nT = RD \/ W\n\nPlug this into the average speed equation:\n\n2W = (3D) \/ (RD\/W + D)\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n2W = (3D) \/ ((RD + WD) \/ W)\n\nNow, solve for R:\n\n2W = 3WD \/ (RD + WD)\n\nMultiply both sides by (RD + WD):\n\n2W(RD + WD) = 3WD\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n2WRD + 2WD^2 = 3WD\n\nDivide both sides by D:\n\n2WR + 2WD = 3W\n\nSince W, R, and D are all positive, we can divide by W:\n\n2R + 2D = 3\n\nBut D = 3W\/R (according to the WT = RD equation), so we'll replace D with 3W\/R:\n\n2R + 2(3W\/R) = 3\n\n2R + 6W\/R = 3\n\nMultiply every term by R to get rid of the fraction:\n\n2R^2 + 6W = 3R\n\nNow, solve for R:\n\n2R^2 - 3R + 6W = 0\n\nYou can see that this is not a simple equation to solve without knowing the specific value for W. However, we know that W is 3mph. This simplifies the equation to:\n\n2R^2 - 3R + 18 = 0\n\nNow it's clear that there is no single integer value for R that would make this equation true.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is infinitely fast, as it's impossible to double the average walking speed by running back under the constraints of this problem.\n\nJSON format: {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""}}
