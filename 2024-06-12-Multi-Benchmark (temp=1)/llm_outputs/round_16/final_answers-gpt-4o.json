Understanding the mechanics of this problem is key to determining the correct strategy. Here\u2019s a detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Initial State:**\n   - There are three doors: Door No. 1, Door No. 2, and Door No. 3.\n   - Behind one of these doors is a gold bar (1\/3 probability).\n   - Behind the other two doors are rotten vegetables (2\/3 probability).\n\n2. **First Choice:**\n   - You pick Door No. 1.\n\n3. **Host's Action:**\n   - The host knows what is behind each door.\n   - After you pick Door No. 1, the host offers you the option of switching to Door No. 2. This implies that the host did not choose Door No. 3 to reveal and switch, because if Door No. 1 had the gold bar, it didn't matter which other door the host offered \u2013 you would still lose by switching. Therefore, under the revised circumstances, the choice between sticking with Door No. 1 or switching to Door No. 2 obeys specific probability rules.\n\n4. **Probability Analysis:**\n   - **If Door No. 1 has the gold bar (Probability: 1\/3):** \n     - Switching to Door No. 2 will result in a loss because you initially chose the door with the gold bar.\n   - **If Door No. 1 has rotten vegetables (Probability: 2\/3):** \n     - The gold bar is behind either Door No. 2 or Door No. 3.\n     - Since the host\u2019s question inherently factors out Door No. 3, Door No. 2 must be where the gold bar is (because if the host was choosing randomly, he would\u2019ve equally given you the option to switch to Door No. 3 but he didn't, focusing probability weight to Door No. 2).\n\nThus, if we consolidate:\n- Sticking with Door No. 1 gives you a 1\/3 chance of winning.\n- Switching to Door No. 2 gives you a 2\/3 chance of winning because initially, you were twice as likely to have picked a door with rotten vegetables.\n\nGiven these probabilities, switching doors maximizes your chances of winning the gold bar.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"A\"\n}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

The taller guardian always tells the truth and guards the death door.\n2. The other guardian always lies (implying they guard the freedom door).\n\nTo determine which door leads to freedom, you can ask either guardian one single question that combines both of their tendencies (truth-telling and lying).\n\n**The key question to ask either guardian is:**\n\"What door would the other guardian say leads to freedom?\"\n\n- When you ask the truth-telling guardian about the other (lying) guardian, the truthful guardian would honestly tell you the lie that the lying guardian would tell (which door the lying guardian would falsely point to as leading to freedom). Since the lying guardian lies, he would indicate the death door as leading to freedom. Therefore, the truthful guardian points to the death door when asked the question.\n  \n- Conversely, when you ask the lying guardian the same question, the lying guardian would lie about the truthful guardian's indication. The truthful guardian would correctly point out the death door, but the lying guardian would tell you the opposite (indicating the freedom door as the death door).\n\nIn both cases, the door indicated by the guardian in response to our question will always be the death door. Hence, the other door is the one to freedom.\n\nThus, you can reliably determine the door to freedom with just one question.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

Let's analyze the options provided:\n\n1. **Option A**: \"Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\" This method is not feasible because the poison takes effect exactly after 24 hours, and there is no immediate way to determine which bottle tastes bitter.\n\n2. **Option B**: \"Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.

Each prisoner represents one bit. By having each prisoner drink from bottles corresponding to their bit being set (1), we can decode the results after 24 hours based on which combination of prisoners died, leading us directly to the poisoned bottle.\n\n3. **Option C**: \"Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\" This is impractical because it does not use the prisoners efficiently and does not solve the problem within the constraints.\n\n4. **Option D**: \"Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\" This method implies dividing the bottles arbitrarily without leveraging the binary system, which is inefficient and potentially dangerous as it does not maximize the efficiency needed to identify the single poisoned bottle within the time limit.\n\nTherefore, the optimal answer is to use the binary strategy described in Option B.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"To clear a hurdle that is 0.5 meters high, the minimum height a man would need to jump is just slightly higher than 0.5 meters to account for any margin of error to ensure he successfully gets over the hurdle without touching or knocking it down.\n\nConsidering the given options:\n- \"A. 0m\" is not feasible because he must leave the ground to clear the hurdle.\n- \"B. 0.5m\" might not be sufficient as he needs to clear the hurdle entirely.\n- \"C. Slightly higher than 0.5m\" is the most appropriate as it considers the need to clear the hurdle with minimal clearance.\n- \"D. Between 0.1m and 0.5m\" is incorrect because it does not reach the height of the hurdle.\n\nThus, the correct choice is \"C. Slightly higher than 0.5m.\"\n\nHere is the JSON format answer:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"30":{"category":"Popular science","question":"I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.

To make up for the time already spent walking, you theoretically have to return in zero time.\n\nThus, you would need to run back at an infinite speed to achieve an overall average speed of 6 mph for the entire trip.\n\nHere's the conclusion in JSON format:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""}}
