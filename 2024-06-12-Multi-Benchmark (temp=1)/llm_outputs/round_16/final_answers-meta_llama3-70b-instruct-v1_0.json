Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"Here's my thought process and answer:\n\nThe key constraint in this problem is the 24-hour time limit, and the fact that the poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. This means that we need to design a testing strategy that can identify the poisoned bottle within a single 24-hour period.\n\nOption A is not viable because the poison doesn't take effect immediately, so the prisoners won't be able to taste the bitterness.\n\nOption C is also not viable because it's not a efficient use of the prisoners, and it would require a huge number of prisoners to test all 1000 bottles.\n\nOption D is also not a good strategy because it would require each prisoner to sample 100 bottles of wine, which is still a large number and may not be feasible.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, is a clever approach that leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n* Each prisoner can be assigned a unique binary number from 0 to 9 (10 prisoners).\n* Each bottle of wine is assigned a unique binary number from 0 to 999 (1000 bottles).\n* Each prisoner drinks from the bottles that correspond to a 1 in their binary number.\n* After 24 hours, the prisoners who are still alive indicate which bottles they drank from.\n* By analyzing the binary numbers of the prisoners who died, the king can determine which bottle is poisoned.\n\nFor example, if prisoner 0 (binary 0000000000) dies, and prisoner 1 (binary 0000000001) lives, and prisoner 2 (binary 0000000010) dies, and so on... the king can deduce that the poisoned bottle is the one that corresponds to the binary number 0000000011 (which is bottle number 3).\n\nThis strategy is efficient because it only requires 10 prisoners to test 1000 bottles of wine, and it can identify the poisoned bottle within a single 24-hour period.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

So, we need to calculate the probability of the complementary event: no two people sharing a birthday.\n\nFor three people, the probability of all having different birthdays is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) = 0.9918.\n\nFor four people, the probability of all having different birthdays is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 (362\/365) = 0.9836.\n\nNotice a pattern? As we add more people, the probability of all having different birthdays decreases rapidly.\n\nUsing this approach, we can calculate the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday for a given number of people.

This means that no matter how many guests are currently staying at the hotel, there will always be an infinite number of empty rooms available.\n\nAt first glance, it might seem like the obvious answer is A. By putting the guest in an empty room. However, this answer doesn't take into account the fact that the hotel is \"partially full\", which implies that there are already some guests staying at the hotel.\n\nA more clever approach is to think about how we can make room for the new guest by rearranging the current guests. Since there are an infinite number of rooms, we can accommodate the new guest by asking each current guest to move to a different room in a way that frees up a room.\n\nOption B, asking each current guest to move to the next room, won't work because it will only shift the occupancy by one room, and we'll still have a problem finding a room for the new guest.\n\nOption D, asking each current guest to move to the room number n*2, is a clever solution. This approach effectively frees up all the odd-numbered rooms, which are now available to accommodate the new guest. For example, if the current guests are occupying rooms 1, 2, 3, ..., we can ask them to move to rooms 2, 4, 6, ..., which frees up rooms 1, 3, 5, ... for the new guest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"26":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A runaway trolley is heading down the tracks away from five people upwards of the track.
