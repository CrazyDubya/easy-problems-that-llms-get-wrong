The key thing to understand is that the initial probabilities don't change.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"The fastest way to identify the poisoned bottle is not by having the prisoners taste the wine and check for bitterness or waiting for someone to die, as these methods do not utilize the 24-hour time frame effectively. The best strategy involves leveraging binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed within the 24-hour time frame.\n\nHere's an explanation of the binary search strategy:\n1. Label each bottle with a unique 3-digit binary number, using 10 digits (000 to 111 in binary, or 0 to 7 in decimal). Since there are 1000 bottles, you will need to group bottles into sets of 8, each representing a unique 3-digit binary number.\n2. Assign each prisoner to represent one of the binary digits (1 through 10).\n3. For each prisoner, have them drink an equal mix of wine from the bottles where the corresponding binary digit is 1.\n4. After 24 hours, identify the prisoners who have been poisoned. Their corresponding binary digits now give you information about the poisoned bottle. Combine these binary numbers to get the final 3-digit binary number that corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nBy using this binary search strategy, the king can efficiently test all 1000 bottles with only 10 prisoners and identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
