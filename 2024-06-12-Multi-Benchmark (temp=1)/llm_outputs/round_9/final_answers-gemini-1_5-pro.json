The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nB.

Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD.

For example, prisoner assigned the 'ones' place drinks from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7...  the prisoner assigned the 'twos' place drinks from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7... and so on.\n    3. **Day 2:** Observe which prisoners die. If the prisoner representing the 'ones' place dies, it means the poisoned bottle's number ends with a 1 in binary. If the prisoner representing the 'twos' place dies, the bottle number has a '1' in the twos place, and so on.  \n    4. **Result:** The dead\/alive status of the prisoners forms a binary number that directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\n* **Why it's fastest:** Binary search is incredibly efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles in a single round.\n\n**Why other options fail:**\n\n* **A:** Tasting the poison won't necessarily be noticeable, and even a small amount could be lethal. \n* **C:** This is incredibly inefficient and would require 10,000 samples.\n* **D:**  Similar to C, this is inefficient and doesn't leverage the 24-hour delay to the poison's full effect. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
