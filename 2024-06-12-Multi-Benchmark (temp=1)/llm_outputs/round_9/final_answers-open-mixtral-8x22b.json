The man first walks 1 km and reaches 300m elevation. Since he's walking straight, we can imagine him at a point A (1km, 300m).\n2. He then makes a left turn, so he's now heading in a direction perpendicular to the first line. After walking another 1 km, he reaches 500m elevation. Now he's at a point B (1km, 500m) from point A. However, to find the total distance from the starting point, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem, which gives us a distance of sqrt((1km)^2 + (200m)^2) \u2248 1.02km. So now, he's 1.02km away from the starting point and at 500m elevation.\n3. He makes another left turn and walks straight for 1 km, reaching 900m elevation. We can imagine him at a point C (1km, 900m) from point B. Again, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from the starting point, which is sqrt((1.02km)^2 + (400m)^2) \u2248 1.1km. This puts him 1.1km away from the starting point and at 900m elevation.\n4. Finally, he turns left again and walks straight for 1 km. Since he's making a left turn each time, and turning left four times will bring him back to his original direction, he will end up at a point D (1km, 900m) from point C, but back parallel to the original line. The distance from the starting point would be sqrt((1.1km)^2 + (0)^2) = 1.1km.\n\nTherefore, the man is 1.1km away from his starting point and still at 900m elevation.\n\nThe closest answer, given the options provided, would be:\n\nC. 2000m from starting point, 900m elevation.\n\nHowever, this is not exactly correct.

Each prisoner would represent a binary digit from 1 to 1023 (2^10 - 1). We would start by labeling each prisoner with a unique binary digit. Then, we would have each prisoner take a sip from the corresponding bottle number based on their binary digit. For example, prisoner 1 takes a sip from bottle 1, prisoner 2 takes a sip from bottle 2, and so on, up to prisoner 10. If none of the prisoners die, we would then move on to the next set of bottles that have digits set according to this binary pattern. By following this method, we can identify the poisoned bottle by checking up to 10 groups of bottles, with each group containing fewer bottles than the previous one. This approach ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle in the fastest way possible, and more importantly, without losing any additional prisoners.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
