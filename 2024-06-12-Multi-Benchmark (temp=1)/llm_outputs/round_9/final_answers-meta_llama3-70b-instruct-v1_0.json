If I ask a question, I can deduce the truth from the answer. Since one guardian always tells the truth and the other always lies, I can use this to my advantage.\n\nHere's the key insight: I don't need to ask about which door leads to freedom or death directly. Instead, I can ask a question that will give me information about the other guardian.\n\nFor example, I can ask the guardian I approach: \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\nThink about it:\n\n* If the guardian I ask is the truth-teller, they will tell me what the liar would say, which would be the wrong door (death door).\n* If the guardian I ask is the liar, they will lie about what the truth-teller would say, which would also point to the wrong door (death door).\n\nSo, in either case, the answer I get will steer me away from the death door. I can then safely choose the other door, which must lead to freedom.\n\nThis approach requires only one question, so I select:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

We want to find the smallest value of n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%.\n\nThe key insight here is that it's easier to calculate the probability of the opposite event: that no two people share a birthday. We can then subtract this probability from 1 to get the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday.\n\nThe probability that the first person has a unique birthday is 365\/365, since there are 365 possible birthdays.\n\nThe probability that the second person has a unique birthday (different from the first person) is 364\/365, since one birthday is already taken.\n\nThe probability that the third person has a unique birthday (different from the first two) is 363\/365, and so on.\n\nThe probability that all 2n people have unique birthdays is therefore:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-2n+1)\/365)\n\nWe want to find the smallest value of n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%.

However, with an infinite number of rooms, this approach would still leave an infinite number of empty rooms, so it's not necessary.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, is a clever approach. By asking each current guest to move to the room number n*2, you're effectively freeing up all the odd-numbered rooms. Since there are an infinite number of rooms, there are also an infinite number of odd-numbered rooms.
