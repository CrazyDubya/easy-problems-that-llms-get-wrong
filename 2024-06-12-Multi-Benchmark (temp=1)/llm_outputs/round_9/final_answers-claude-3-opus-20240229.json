Each pair of twins shares the same birthday.\n2. We can treat each pair of twins as a single entity since their birthdays are the same.\n3. The problem then becomes similar to the famous \"Birthday Problem,\" which asks how many people need to be in a room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n4. The formula for the probability of no two people sharing the same birthday in a group of n people is: P(no match) = 365!\/(365^n * (365-n)!)\n5. We want the probability of a match to be at least 50%, so we set P(no match) \u2264 0.5 and solve for n.\n6. Using this formula, we find that for n \u2265 23, the probability of a match is greater than 50%.\n\nSince each pair of twins counts as one entity in this problem, we need 23 pairs of twins in the room to have at least a 50% chance that two people (or two pairs of twins) have the same birthday.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
