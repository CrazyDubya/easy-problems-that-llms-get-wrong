Here's the detailed reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Choice**: You initially have three doors to choose from. The probability of picking the door with the gold bar (winning door) is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\), and the probability of picking a door with rotten vegetables (losing door) is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\n2. **Host's Intervention**: The host knows what's behind each door and will always offer you to switch by showing you a door with rotten vegetables after your initial choice. \n\n3. **Switching Strategy**:\n    - If you initially picked the door with the gold bar (probability \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)), switching will lose (since the other door will have rotten vegetables).\n    - If you initially picked a door with rotten vegetables (probability \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\)), the host shows you the other door with rotten vegetables, and switching will win (as the remaining door will have the gold bar).\n\nBy switching, you capitalize on the \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) probability that your initial choice was incorrect. Therefore, the probability of winning by switching is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), while sticking with your initial choice holds the probability of winning at \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nGiven this analysis, the best strategy is to switch doors. Since you are asked whether to switch to door No. 2 or maintain your initial choice, switching to door No. 2 (or any door other than your first choice, since the host has shown you which one has rotten vegetables) is the optimal strategy.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

After the opponent fires and does not get shot, that means the empty chamber is already known and is one of the remaining chambers.\n\nHere's the critical reasoning:\n\n1. **If you do not spin again:**\n   - There is one known chamber that is empty because it did not fire on your opponent.\n   - There are five chambers left, and four of those contain bullets.\n   - Therefore, without spinning, the probability of you firing and encountering a bullet is 4\/5 or 80%.\n\n2. **If you spin again:**\n   - Spinning the chambers randomizes the position again, making the empty chamber equally likely to be in any of the six positions.\n   - The probability of firing and encountering a bullet resets to 5\/6 or approximately 83.33%.\n\nGiven these probabilities, **not spinning** again gives you a lower chance of encountering a bullet (80%) compared to spinning again (83.33%).

If you ask the truth-telling guardian (who guards the death door), they will honestly tell you what the lying guardian (who guards the freedom door) would say. The lying guardian would lie and point you towards the death door.\n2. If you ask the lying guardian, they will lie about what the truth-telling guardian (guarding the death door) would say.

We need to maximize the information gathered from each prisoner to minimize the total tests required.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Binary Number Strategy**:\n   - Each prisoner can be used as a binary digit (bit) in a binary number.\n   - With 10 prisoners, we can represent numbers from 0 to \\(2^{10} - 1\\), which is from 0 to 1023. This is more than enough to represent the 1000 bottles because \\(2^{10} = 1024\\).\n\n2. **Testing Process**: \n   - Number each bottle from 0 to 999.\n   - Convert each bottle number to a 10-bit binary number.\n   - Assign each bit of this binary number to a prisoner.\n   - For each bottle's binary number, if a bit is 1, that prisoner drinks from that bottle.\n\n3. **Result Interpretation**:\n   - After 24 hours, observe which combination of prisoners have died.\n   - Combine these prisoners' \"1\" or \"0\" positions to form the binary number corresponding to the poisoned bottle.\n  \nThis ensures that we can find the poisoned bottle in one round of testing, maximizing efficiency using the properties of binary representation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe described method is a binary search strategy using prisoners as bits which allows the identification of the poisoned bottle in exactly 24 hours.

The reasoning behind this is based on probability calculations where the likelihood of all individuals having different birthdays significantly decreases as more people are added.\n\nSince each pair of twins shares the same birthday, the calculation changes slightly. Each pair of twins effectively counts as one distinct birthday, so we need to count the total number of people, not just the number of pairs.\n\nTo achieve a 50% probability of two people sharing the same birthday solely with twins, we need the total number of individuals, which is equivalent to 23 people. Since each pair of twins counts as two people, we need half of this number in pairs, rounding up if necessary to ensure we meet or exceed the threshold:\n\n\\[ 23 \\div 2 = 11.5 \\]\n\nSince we can't have half a pair of twins, it makes sense to round up to the nearest whole number, which results in:\n\n\\[ 12 \\text{ pairs of twins} \\]\n\nTherefore, the calculation indicates that we need 12 pairs of twins to exceed that 50% probability threshold.\n\nHence, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Trees primarily grow by converting carbon dioxide from the air into plant matter through the process of photosynthesis, using sunlight and water. During this process, they absorb nutrients and water from the soil, but the mass gained by the tree is not directly equivalent to a decrease in soil mass \u2013 it largely comes from the carbon dioxide in the air.\n\nThus, the amount of soil left in the pot will be approximately the same as it was initially, assuming minimal soil is lost through other means such as watering or erosion.\n\nGiven that the pot initially had 10kg of soil, the soil amount will remain virtually the same.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"29":{"category":"Relational","question":"A man steps over a 0.5m hurdle.

Let's assume the distance to your friend's house is \\(d\\) miles.\n2. The speed walking to the house is 3 mph.\n3. The time it takes to walk to your friend's house is given by \\( \\text{time} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\nNow, let's define the variables for the trip back:\n- Let \\(v\\) be the speed we need to run back to double the average speed for the entire trip.\n\nThe total distance for the entire trip is \\(2d\\) (going to the friend's house and coming back).\n\nOur target is to have an average speed for the entire trip to be double the walking speed, which would be \\(6\\) mph (since \\(2 \\times 3 \\text{ mph} = 6 \\text{ mph}\\)).\n\nThe formula for average speed is:\n\\[ \\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{2d}{ \\left( \\frac{d}{3} + \\text{time running back} \\right) } \\]\n\nSolving for the total time to make the average speed 6 mph:\n\\[ 6 \\left( \\frac{d}{3} + \\text{time running back} \\right) = 2d \\]\n\n\\[ 6 \\frac{d}{3} + 6 \\times \\text{time running back} = 2d \\]\n\n\\[ 2d + 6 \\times \\text{time running back} = 2d \\]\n\n\\[ 6 \\times \\text{time running back} = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{time running back} = 0 \\]\n\nThis implies that the only way to achieve an average speed of 6 mph for the entire trip is if the time running back is zero, which means you would have to run infinitely fast.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""}}
