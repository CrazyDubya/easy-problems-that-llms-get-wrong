The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nD. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"Here is my analysis:\n\nThe key considerations are:\n1) There are 1000 bottles of wine and only 10 prisoners to test them\n2) The poison takes effect after exactly 24 hours, so there is only time for one round of testing\n3) The question asks for the fastest way to identify the poisoned bottle\n\nWith 1000 bottles and 10 prisoners, having each prisoner sample all the bottles (D) or even dividing the bottles evenly among the prisoners (B, C) would require each prisoner to drink from 100 bottles, which is not practical or safe.\n\nThe fastest method that leverages the 24 hour timeframe and 10 prisoners is to use a binary search strategy (A). Represent each bottle with a 10-digit binary number, with each digit corresponding to a prisoner. For example:\n0000000001 = Prisoner 1 drinks this bottle\n0000000010 = Prisoner 2 drinks this bottle\n0000000011 = Prisoner 1 and 2 drink this bottle\nThis allows testing up to 2^10 = 1024 bottles with 10 prisoners.\n\nEach prisoner samples the bottles corresponding to their assigned bit. After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners showing poisoning symptoms will reveal the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nTherefore, a binary search is the fastest method given the parameters.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
