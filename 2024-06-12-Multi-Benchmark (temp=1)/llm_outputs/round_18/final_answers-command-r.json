With 2 pairs of twins, the probability increases to 1\/365 * 1\/364 = 1\/133,060. \n\nAssuming each additional pair of twins doubles the likelihood, we can calculate the minimum number of pairs required.\n\n1 x 2 = 2 pairs\n2 x 2 = 4 pairs\n4 x 2 = 8 pairs\n8 x 2 = 16 pairs\n16 x 2 = 32 pairs\n32 x 2 = 64 pairs\n64 x 2 = 128 pairs\n\nTherefore, with 128 pairs of twins, there is a 50% chance that two people in the room share the same birthday.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Fill the 5-gallon jug and pour its contents into the 4-gallon jug. Now we have one jug with 5 gallons and another with 4 gallons.\n\n2. Pour the 4-gallon jug into the larger 5-gallon jug, which will displace the water and force the extra 1 gallon out. This leaves you with exactly 4 gallons in the 5-gallon jug.\n\n3. Repeat this process, as the 5-gallon jug now has 4 gallons. By performing this step again, you'll end up with 3 gallons in the larger jug and another 4 gallons in the smaller one, adding up to your desired quantity of 7 gallons.\n\nOption A best describes this method: \"Filling the 5-gallon jug and pouring it into the 3-gallon jug, twice.\"","score":""},"28":{"category":"Popular science","question":"A 2kg tree grows in a planted pot with 10kg of soil.
