Using a binary search strategy:** This is the most efficient approach. By assigning unique binary codes to each prisoner and each bottle, and having them taste combinations based on their code, the king can identify the poisoned bottle within 10 rounds (24 hours). This requires careful planning and organization but minimizes the number of tastings needed.\n\n**B. Getting all prisoners to sample each bottle:** This is not feasible. Each prisoner can only drink once before succumbing to the poison, making it impossible to test all 1000 bottles within the 24-hour timeframe. Additionally, this approach is highly unethical and would result in the unnecessary deaths of all prisoners.\n\n**C. Dividing the bottles among the prisoners:** While seemingly efficient, this approach only allows for one tasting per prisoner. If the poisoned bottle ends up with a prisoner who receives a non-poisoned bottle, the king would have no information about its location and would lose valuable time. \n\n**D. Noting which bottle tastes bitter:** While the poisoned wine might have a distinct taste, relying solely on this method is unreliable. Not everyone perceives bitterness the same way, and the poison could be masked by the sweetness of the wine.

While the question asks about twins, the analysis remains the same, as we only care about shared birthdays, not the relationship between the individuals.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can calculate the probability of **no** shared birthdays and then subtract it from 1 to find the probability of at least one shared birthday. This approach is easier than directly calculating the probability of a shared birthday.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n- **Probability of no shared birthdays:**\n\nImagine we have 23 people (or pairs of twins in this case) and 365 possible birthdays (ignoring leap years for simplicity). The probability that the first person has a unique birthday is 365\/365 = 1. \n\nFor the second person, the probability of having a different birthday is 364\/365. This continues for each person, so the total probability of no shared birthdays for 23 people is:\n\n(365\/365) * (364\/365) * ... * (343\/365) \u2248 0.4927\n\n- **Probability of at least one shared birthday:**\n\n1 - 0.4927 = 0.5073.

This is because the average speed is calculated by adding the speed of both legs of the trip and dividing by 2. \n\nIf you walk at 3mph to your friend's house, the total distance covered is d = rt = 3t, where t is the time taken. To double your average speed, you would need to run back at a speed of 6mph, covering the same distance in half the time, or t\/2. \n\nTherefore, the total time taken for the round trip would be t + t\/2 = 3t\/2. The average speed for the round trip would then be:\n\n```\nAverage speed = (Total distance) \/ (Total time) = 2d \/ (3t\/2) = 4d \/ 3t = (4\/3) * (3mph) = 4mph\n```\n\nAs you can see, by running at 6mph on your way back, you would double your average speed for the entire trip to 4mph, which is twice the speed you walked at initially. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""}}
