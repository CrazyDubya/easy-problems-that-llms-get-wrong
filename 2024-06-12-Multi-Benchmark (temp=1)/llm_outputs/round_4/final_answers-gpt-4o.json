Here is the reasoning to determine which door gives you the biggest advantage:\n\n1. **Initial Probability**: When you first pick a door (say Door No. 1), the probability that the gold bar is behind that door is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (either Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host then offers you the choice to switch to Door No. 2. In doing so, the host likely knows where the gold bar is and is guiding your decision.\n\n3. **Switching Doors**: If you switch to Door No. 2, the probability of winning increases due to the initial probability breakdown. Here's why: \n   - If the gold bar is behind Door No. 2 or Door No. 3, switching will lead you to win in 2 out of 3 cases.\n   - Remaining with your original choice (Door No. 1) keeps the winning probability at 1\/3.\n\nBy switching doors, you effectively capitalize on the higher combined probability (2\/3) that the gold bar is not behind Door No. 1.\n\nGiven that the host offers you the option to switch to Door No. 2 specifically, and considering the strategic advantage of switching as discussed in the Monty Hall problem, Door No. 2 provides the best chance of winning.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

One effective question you can ask is:\n\n\"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would they say?\"\n\nHere\u2019s the logic behind it:\n1. If you ask the truth-telling guardian, they will tell you the lie the other guardian would tell you. Hence, they will point to the door that leads to death.\n2.

Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.**\n\n- With 1000 bottles and 10 prisoners, each prisoner would have to sample 100 bottles. Since there is only one poisoned bottle, there's a significant risk of multiple prisoners ingesting the poison, which is highly inefficient and unethical.\n\n**B. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours**\n\n- This method leverages the concept of binary representation of the bottle numbers. Each prisoner represents a power of 2 (binary place value), and each bottle is assigned a unique binary number between 0000000000 (0) and 1111101000 (999). By having each prisoner drink a combination of the wines that corresponds to their \"1\" in the binary number, within 24 hours, the subset of prisoners that die correspond to the binary number of the poisoned bottle. This method efficiently identifies the poisoned bottle within the constraint.\n\n**C. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.**\n\n- This option is unethical and impossible since it requires each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles.\n\n**D. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.**\n\n- This assumes the prisoners can detect which wine is poisoned based purely on taste. It is unlikely and infeasible since the problem states the poison takes 24 hours to show effect, implying no noticeable immediate taste difference.\n\nThus, the most systematic and feasible approach under the conditions given is **B**. It effectively uses the 10 prisoners within the 24-hour timeframe to identify the specific poisoned bottle with minimal risk.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The tree itself growing does not consume the weight of the soil directly.\n2. Typically, a tree absorbs nutrients from the soil, but the mass of those nutrients is minimal compared to the overall mass of the soil.\n3. The primary elements that contribute to the growth of the tree (i.e., carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen) come from water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air.\n\nGiven these considerations, the weight of the soil remains essentially unchanged when the tree grows. Therefore, the amount of soil left in the pot remains the same.\n\nAfter evaluating the potential answers, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"29":{"category":"Relational","question":"A man steps over a 0.5m hurdle.
