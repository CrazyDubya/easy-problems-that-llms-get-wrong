The gold bar is still equally likely to be behind any of the doors you didn't choose.\n\nHowever, the host, who knows what's behind each door, always opens a door with rotten vegetables. This action provides new information that changes the probabilities. Since the host can't open the door with the gold bar, the probability shifts to the other unopened door.\n\nSo, if you initially chose Door No. 1, and the host opens, say, Door No. 3 to reveal rotten vegetables, the probability of the gold bar being behind Door No. 2 is now 2\/3, while the probability of it being behind Door No. 1 remains 1\/3.\n\nTherefore, you should switch your choice to the other unopened door to maximize your chances of winning the gold bar.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

When your opponent fired the gun and it didn't go off, that means the chamber was empty. Since the gun was spun randomly initially, each chamber had an equal 1\/6 chance of being empty. But now that we know one chamber is empty, the probability distribution changes.\n\nIf you don't spin, you're betting on the next chamber being empty, which has a 1\/6 chance. But if you do spin, the empty chamber gets mixed back in with the others, so you have a 1\/6 chance of landing on the empty chamber again, plus a 1\/6 chance for each of the other chambers, one of which we know is empty.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is not by dividing the bottles amongst the prisoners and waiting for one to die (Option A), or having all prisoners sample each bottle (Option C), as these methods would likely result in unnecessary deaths and may not yield a clear answer. Option D is also not viable as the poison is described as bitter but only takes effect after 24 hours, so it wouldn't be immediately noticeable.\n\nThe most efficient method would be Option B, using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it could work:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique number that can be represented in binary using no more than 10 digits (since there are 10 prisoners). For example, the first bottle could be 0000000001, the second 0000000010, the third 0000000011, and so on, up to the 1000th bottle, which could be represented as 1111101000.\n\n2. For each prisoner, prepare a mixture of wines corresponding to the wines labeled with a '1' in the corresponding binary digit. For example, the first prisoner would drink from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on (all the bottles labeled with a '1' in the first binary digit); the second prisoner from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, and so on (all the bottles labeled with a '1' in the second binary digit); and so on.\n\n3. After 24 hours, check which prisoners have been poisoned. The binary numbers corresponding to these prisoners, when combined, will give the binary representation of the poisoned bottle's number.\n\nThis method allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours and minimizes the number of prisoners who will be poisoned.\n\nSo, the answer in JSON format is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
