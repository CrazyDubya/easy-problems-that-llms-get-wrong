What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"Here is my analysis of the possible answers to find the poisoned wine bottle:\n\nA. Dividing the 1000 bottles among 10 prisoners would require each prisoner to drink from 100 bottles. This would likely kill all the prisoners and still not definitively identify the single poisoned bottle.\n\nB. A binary search strategy could work well here. Number the bottles 0 to 999 and represent each number as a 10-digit binary number (e.g. bottle 0 is 0000000000, bottle 1 is 0000000001, etc). Have each prisoner take a sip from every bottle that has a 1 in their assigned digit position. After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners that are dead will give you the binary digits of the poisoned bottle number. This requires only 10 sips total, one per prisoner, and will definitively identify the single poisoned bottle.\n\nC. Having all 10 prisoners sample all 1000 bottles would require 10,000 sips total. This is very inefficient and would likely kill all the prisoners from the cumulative effects of the poison.\n\nD. Having the prisoners divide and taste the wine for bitterness would not work, as the question states the poison is very bitter but does not say the wine itself is not also bitter. The prisoners could not reliably identify the poisoned bottle this way.\n\nTherefore, the binary search strategy in answer B is the fastest and most effective way to identify the single poisoned wine bottle using the 10 prisoners.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
