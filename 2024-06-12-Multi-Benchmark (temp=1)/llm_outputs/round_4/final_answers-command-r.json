Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n\nThere are 365 days in a year, so the probability of two people having the same birthday is 1\/365. With 2 people in a room, the chance that they have the same birthday is 1\/365 * 1\/364 = 1\/133,060.\n\nAssuming each additional pair of twins also has a unique birthday, the probability of three people having the same birthday is 1\/365 * 1\/364 * 1\/363, and so on.\n\nWith the probabilities multiplied for each new pair, we get the following:\n\n- 4 people: 1\/133,060 * 1\/133,059 = 1\/17,715,605\n- 5 people: 1\/17,715,605 * 1\/17,715,604 = 1\/299,833,696\n- 6 people: 1\/299,833,696 * 1\/299,833,695 = 1\/8,989,654,401\n- 7 people: 1\/8,989,654,401 * 1\/8,989,654,400 = 1\/79,833,691,441\n- 8 people: 1\/79,833,691,441 * 1\/79,833,691,440 = 1\/638,512,868,761\n- 9 people: half probability - 1\/1,277,145,536\n\nWe can thus conclude that with 12 pairs of twins (9 people total), there will be a 50% chance of finding a pair with matching birthdays.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
