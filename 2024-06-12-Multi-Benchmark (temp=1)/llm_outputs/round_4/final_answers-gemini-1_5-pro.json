Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the answer is B and why the others are incorrect:\\n\\n* **A. Incorrect.** This would likely kill all the prisoners as they'd each be consuming a small amount from many bottles.\\n* **B. Correct.**  Binary search is the most efficient way. Here's how it works:\\n    1. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\\n    2. **Number the Bottles:**  Imagine each bottle has a number from 1 to 1000.\\n    3. **Convert Bottle Numbers to Binary:** Convert each bottle's number into its binary representation (e.g., bottle 1 is 0000000001, bottle 2 is 0000000010, bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.).\\n    4. **Prisoners Drink Based on Binary:**  Each prisoner drinks from bottles where the bottle's binary representation has a '1' in the position corresponding to the prisoner's number. For example:\\n        * Prisoner 1 drinks from bottles where the rightmost binary digit is a '1'.\\n        * Prisoner 2 drinks from bottles where the second binary digit from the right is a '1'.\\n        * And so on...\\n    5. **Identify the Poisoned Bottle:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die. The binary representation of the poisoned bottle's number will be formed by placing a '1' where a prisoner died and a '0' where a prisoner lived. \\n* **C. Incorrect.**  Similar to option A, this would be highly inefficient and likely fatal to all prisoners.\\n* **D. Incorrect.** The poison only takes effect after 24 hours, so a taste test wouldn't help. \\n\\n**Binary search is optimal because it reduces the possibilities by half with each test, making it possible to test a large number of items (1000 bottles) with a small number of tests (maximum of 10 prisoners).**\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
