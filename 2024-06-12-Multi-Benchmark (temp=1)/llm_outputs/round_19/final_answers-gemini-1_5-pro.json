Here's how it applies to the wine problem:\n\n1. **Number the Prisoners and Bottles:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.  Similarly, imagine each bottle of wine is numbered from 1 to 1000.\n\n2. **Convert Prisoner Number to Binary:** Think of each prisoner's number in its binary form:\n   * Prisoner 1:  0000000001\n   * Prisoner 2:  0000000010\n   * Prisoner 3:  0000000011\n   * ... and so on\n\n3. **Assign Wine Based on Binary:** Each bottle of wine's number also has a binary representation. A prisoner drinks from a bottle if their corresponding binary digit position (from the right) is a '1'. \n   * Example: Bottle 5 (binary 0000000101): Prisoners 1, 3, and 10 would drink from this bottle.\n\n4. **Observe After 24 Hours:**  Note which prisoners die. The dead prisoners' binary representations will reveal the binary code of the poisoned bottle.\n\n5. **Decode the Poisoned Bottle:** Combine the binary representations of the dead prisoners to get the poisoned bottle's number.\n\n**Example:** If prisoners 1 and 3 die, the poisoned bottle is 0000000011 in binary, which is bottle number 3.\n\n**Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n* **A and B:** Tasting wouldn't work as the poison acts too slowly, and a single sip might not be detectable.\n* **C:** This is highly inefficient and would require a massive amount of wine consumption, likely killing all the prisoners.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
