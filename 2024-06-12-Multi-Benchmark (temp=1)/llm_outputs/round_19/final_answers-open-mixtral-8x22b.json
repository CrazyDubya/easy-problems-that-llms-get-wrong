Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n\nExplanation:\nThe best way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed by dividing the problem into smaller subsets, making it faster and more efficient. By leveraging the concept of binary numbers, the king can determine the exact position of the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time.\n\nIn this case, the king would divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100, with each prisoner testing one bottle from each group. If a prisoner dies within 24 hours, the king would know that the poisoned bottle is in the group that the prisoner tested. If no one dies, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was not tested.\n\nThe king would then repeat this process with the remaining prisoners and groups until the poisoned bottle is identified. This method requires a maximum of 24 hours per round, allowing the king to identify the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time possible.\n\nOption A is incorrect because sacrificing a prisoner to find the poisoned bottle is cruel and unethical. Option B is also incorrect because the poison may not have a bitter taste, or the prisoners may not be able to taste the poison. Option C is incorrect because this method would require all prisoners to taste all 1000 bottles, which is impractical and would take too long. Therefore, option D is the best choice.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Since you walk at 3mph, the time T can be expressed as T = D\/3.\n\nThe average speed for the entire round trip is the total distance (which is 2D) divided by the total time. You're looking to double your average speed from the walking speed of 3mph, so your goal is to double the average speed to 6mph.\n\nLet's denote the running speed for the return trip as R (in mph). The time it takes to run back from your friend's house at this speed is D\/R. Therefore, the average speed for the entire trip is (2D) \/ (T + D\/R).\n\nSubstitute T = D\/3 into the average speed expression:\n\nAverage Speed = (2D) \/ (D\/3 + D\/R)\n\nSince you want to double the average speed to 6mph, set this equal to 6mph:\n\n6mph = (2D) \/ (D\/3 + D\/R)\n\nNow, solve for R:\n\n18D = 3D + DR\n15D = DR\nR = 15D\/D\n\nSince D\/D is equal to 1, R = 15.\n\nHowever, this calculation assumes that the distances for walking to your friend's house and running back are the same, which might not be realistic (e.g., if you take shortcuts while running).
