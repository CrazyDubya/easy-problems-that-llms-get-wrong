The key is that the host knows what's behind each door and is intentionally giving you an opportunity to switch to a door with a higher probability of winning.\n\nInitially, you had a 1\/3 probability of picking the correct door. When the host asks if you want to switch to door 2 instead, he is not asking randomly. He knows door 2 has a higher chance of having the gold bar.\n\nIf you stick with door 1, you still only have a 1\/3 chance of winning. But if you switch to the door the host suggests, you actually have a 2\/3 probability of winning, because the host is steering you away from the door with rotten vegetables.\n\nSo the best strategy is to always switch doors when given the chance by the host, which in this case means picking door 2.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Assign each prisoner a unique binary number from 0 to 9 (1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, 1010 in binary). Number the wine bottles from 1 to 1000. For each bottle number, look at the binary representation, and have the corresponding prisoners (based on their assigned binary number) take a sip from that bottle. After 24 hours, the king can look at which prisoners have died and deduce the binary number of the poisoned bottle. For example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 4 die (corresponding to binary digits 1, 11, 100), then bottle 111 (7) was poisoned.
