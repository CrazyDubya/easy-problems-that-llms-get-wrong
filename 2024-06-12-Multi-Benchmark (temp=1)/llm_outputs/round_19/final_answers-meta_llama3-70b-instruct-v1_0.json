Since the poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption, we can use a binary search strategy to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Assign a binary number to each prisoner, from 0 to 9 (2^10 - 1 = 1024, which is more than the number of bottles).\n2. Label each bottle with a binary number from 0 to 999.\n3. For each prisoner, have them drink from the bottles corresponding to a 1 in their binary number. For example, prisoner 0 (0000000000) drinks from bottles 0, 256, 512, and 768. Prisoner 1 (0000000001) drinks from bottles 1, 257, 513, and 769, and so on.\n4. Wait 24 hours and observe which prisoners die.\n5. Use the binary numbers of the dead prisoners to determine which bottle is poisoned.
