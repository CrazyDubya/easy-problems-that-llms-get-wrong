The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"D\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe most efficient solution is **D. Using a binary search strategy**. Here's why:\n\n* **A is incorrect** because it's inefficient and morally reprehensible. It also only provides information about one bottle.\n* **B is incorrect** because the poison is stated to be tasteless (only taking effect after 24 hours).\n* **C is incorrect** because it's impossible for each prisoner to sample 1000 bottles.\n\n**Binary Search Strategy:**\n\n1. **Number the prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n2. **Number the bottles:**  Assign each bottle a binary number from 0000000001 (1) to 1111101000 (1000).\n3. **Assign wine based on binary:**  Each prisoner drinks from bottles where their corresponding binary digit is a \"1\". For example:\n    * Prisoner 1 drinks from every bottle with a \"1\" in the rightmost digit of its binary representation (1, 3, 5, 7...999).\n    * Prisoner 2 drinks from every bottle with a \"1\" in the second digit from the right (2, 3, 6, 7...1000), and so on. \n4. **Observe after 24 hours:**  The prisoners who die represent a \"1\" in their corresponding binary digit. Those who live represent a \"0\".  Construct the binary number from the dead\/alive status of the prisoners. This binary number directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\n**Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0001100001, which translates to bottle number 289.\n\n**Why Binary Search Works:**  This method leverages the power of binary representation.  With 10 prisoners, you can create 2^10 (1024) unique combinations, allowing you to test up to 1024 bottles simultaneously. \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
