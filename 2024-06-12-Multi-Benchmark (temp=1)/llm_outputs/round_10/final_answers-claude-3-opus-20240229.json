The key is that the host knows what's behind each door and is intentionally offering you the option to switch to a specific door.\n\nInitially, you have a 1\/3 probability of choosing the correct door. When the host gives you the option to switch to door 2 instead, he is eliminating door 3 from consideration. This means door 3 definitely does not have the gold bar.\n\nIf your initial pick of door 1 was incorrect (2\/3 probability), then door 2 must have the gold bar. Switching to door 2 when offered the choice will let you win the gold 2\/3 of the time. Sticking with door 1 only wins 1\/3 of the time.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy is to always switch doors when given the option, as it doubles your chances of winning compared to staying with your initial pick.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

A binary search strategy can achieve this by assigning each prisoner a unique binary digit and having them sample wine from bottles corresponding to their digit being 1 in that bottle's binary number. After 24 hours, the prisoners who sampled the poisoned wine will have died, and the binary number formed by their assigned digits will identify the poisoned bottle number.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"To solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of two people having the same birthday in a room full of pairs of twins.\n\nFirst, let's consider the probability of two people not having the same birthday. For the first person, the probability is 1 (100%). For the second person, the probability is 364\/365 (assuming no leap years). For the third person, it's 363\/365, and so on.\n\nThe probability of no two people having the same birthday is:\n\nP(no match) = 1 * (364\/365) * (363\/365) * ... * ((365-n+1)\/365)\n\nwhere n is the number of people in the room.\n\nWe want to find the smallest n such that P(no match) \u2264 0.5, or equivalently, P(at least one match) \u2265 0.5.\n\nNow, since we are dealing with pairs of twins, each pair is guaranteed to have the same birthday. So, we can treat each pair as a single entity. In other words, we need to find the number of pairs of twins, not the number of individuals.\n\nLet's try the given options:\n\nA. 46 pairs: This would be 92 individuals, which is more than enough to have a 50% chance of a match.\nB. 12 pairs: This is 24 individuals. The probability of no match is still quite high with 24 people.\nC. 1 pair: With just 2 people, the probability of a match is very low.\nD. 23 pairs: This is 46 individuals. This is close to the well-known \"birthday problem\" where 23 people are needed for a 50% chance of a match.\n\nAfter considering the options, 23 pairs (46 individuals) seems to be the closest to the correct answer.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Choosing not to pull the lever would result in the trolley continuing on its current path and likely killing the five people. So pulling the lever has a direct impact on saving the lives of those five individuals.\n\nHowever, the question does not specify whether there are any people on the other track that the trolley would be diverted onto. If there are people on that track, then pulling the lever would endanger their lives instead. This introduces an ethical dilemma of whether it is right to take an action that saves a greater number of lives at the cost of sacrificing a smaller number. \n\nDifferent ethical frameworks would analyze this dilemma in different ways, considering factors like intentions, consequences, duties, and rights. But in any case, the act of pulling the lever (or not pulling it) definitely has a significant impact on the outcomes for the people involved.\n\nGiven the information provided in the question, the best answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n\nPulling the lever will save the lives of the five people, since it diverts the trolley away from them.
