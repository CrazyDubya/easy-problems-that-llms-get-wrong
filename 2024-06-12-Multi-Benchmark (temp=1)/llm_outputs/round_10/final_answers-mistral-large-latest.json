Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n\nExplanation:\nThe fastest and most efficient way to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. Here's why:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles of wine into 10 groups (since we have 10 prisoners) and assign a binary number from 0 to 1023 (2^10 - 1) to each bottle.\n2. Each binary digit corresponds to one of the 10 prisoners. If the digit is 1 for a certain bottle and prisoner, then that prisoner tests that bottle.\n3. After 24 hours, observe the symptoms in the prisoners. The prisoners who die will represent the binary digits that equal 1 for the poisoned bottle.\n4. Convert the binary pattern obtained from the dead prisoners back to the decimal form to identify the poisoned bottle number.\n\nThis method not only gives us the poisoned bottle within 24 hours but also minimizes the number of tests needed. The king needs to test only a fraction of the bottles with the help of prisoners, instead of the naive approach of assigning one bottle to each prisoner.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
