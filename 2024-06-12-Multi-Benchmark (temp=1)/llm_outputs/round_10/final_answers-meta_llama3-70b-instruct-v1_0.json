Since there's only one torch, only two people can cross at a time. We need to find the optimal pairing to minimize the total time.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. A and B cross together (takes 2 minutes). Then, A returns with the torch (takes 1 minute). Now, C and D cross together (takes 10 minutes). Finally, B returns with the torch (takes 2 minutes).

After 24 hours, record which prisoners died.\n5. Convert the binary numbers of the dead prisoners back to decimal and find the intersection of the sets of bottles they tasted. This will identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis strategy takes advantage of the fact that there are 10 prisoners and 1000 bottles, allowing the king to identify the poisoned bottle in a single round of testing.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

In a room with only one pair of twins, the probability of the twins having the same birthday is 1 (100%), but the probability of two random people having the same birthday is only 1\/365 (since there are 365 possible birthdays).\n\nSo, to find the smallest number of pairs of twins needed for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday, we need to find the smallest number of people in the room such that the probability of at least two people having the same birthday is greater than or equal to 50%.\n\nUsing the birthday problem formula, we can calculate the probability of at least two people having the same birthday as:\n\nP(at least two people have the same birthday) = 1 - P(all people have different birthdays)\n\nwhere P(all people have different birthdays) = (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365)\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate that with 23 pairs of twins (i.e., 46 people in the room), the probability of at least two people having the same birthday is approximately 50.7%.

For example, if the hotel currently has guests in rooms 1, 2, 3, ..., we would move the guest in room 1 to room 2, the guest in room 2 to room 4, the guest in room 3 to room 6, and so on.
