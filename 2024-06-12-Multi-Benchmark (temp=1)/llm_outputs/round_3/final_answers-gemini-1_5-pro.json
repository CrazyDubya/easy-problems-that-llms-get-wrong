The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"D\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the answer is D and why the others won't work:\n\n* **A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.**  This assumes the poison has an immediate, detectable taste. The problem states the poison takes 24 hours to take effect.\n\n* **B. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.**  This is inefficient and morally wrong. You'd need all 10 prisoners to potentially die to test 10 bottles.\n\n* **C. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.**  This is even more inefficient and unethical. All prisoners would die.\n\n* **D. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours**  This is the correct approach. Here's how it works:\n\n**Binary Search Explanation:**\n\n1. **Number the bottles:** Assign each bottle a number from 1 to 1000.\n2. **Number the prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n3. **Binary representation:** Think of each prisoner representing a place value in a binary number (e.g., prisoner 1 is the 'ones' place, prisoner 2 is the 'twos' place, prisoner 3 is the 'fours' place, and so on). \n4. **Assign wine:**  Each prisoner will drink from bottles based on their corresponding binary place value. For example:\n   * Prisoner 1 drinks from every bottle with a '1' in the units place of its binary representation (1, 3, 5, 7...999).\n   * Prisoner 2 drinks from every bottle with a '1' in the twos place of its binary representation (2, 3, 6, 7... 1000).\n   * And so on...\n5. **Observe after 24 hours:**  Note which prisoners die. This forms your binary code. For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0110000001, which converts to decimal 801. Bottle 801 is the poisoned one.\n\n**Why binary search is efficient:** Binary search allows you to test a large number of possibilities quickly. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles in a single round. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
