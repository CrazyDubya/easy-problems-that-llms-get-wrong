The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"Here is my analysis:\n\nThe key to solving this efficiently is leveraging the 24 hour delay between consuming the poison and its effects. This allows us to test many combinations of wine bottles in parallel using the 10 prisoners.\n\nThe optimal approach is to number the wine bottles from 1 to 1000 and write each number in binary format (which will be 10 digits long for numbers up to 1000). Then, have each prisoner sample the wines corresponding to the bottles where their \"prisoner number\" digit is a 1.  \n\nFor example, Prisoner 1 will sample every bottle with a 1 in the 1's place (odd numbered bottles). Prisoner 2 samples every bottle with a 1 in the 2's place (numbers 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, etc.). This continues up to Prisoner 10 sampling bottles with a 1 in the 10th digit (512, 513, 514, etc.)\n\nAfter 24 hours, by seeing which prisoners have died, the king can determine the binary number corresponding to the single poisoned bottle. At most 10 tests are needed, much fewer than individually testing each bottle.\n\nTherefore, the fastest method is using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners (choice D).\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
