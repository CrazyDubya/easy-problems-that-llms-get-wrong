This eliminates Door No. 1 as a viable option.\n\nNow, let's analyze the remaining doors:\n\n- **Door No. 2:** This door was initially chosen by the host as a potential switch, implying there's a higher chance of the gold being behind it.\n- **Door No. 3:** This door was untouched by both the initial choice and the host's suggestion.

If the shorter guardian says the taller guardian is telling the truth, then the first answer is correct. If the shorter guardian says the taller guardian is lying, then the second answer is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy asking the shorter guardian two specific questions, you can determine the correct door and escape to freedom.","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Binary Representation:** We assign a unique binary code to each bottle, using digits 0 and 1. With 10 prisoners, we can represent 1024 bottles (2^10). Each prisoner is assigned a specific binary code.\n\n2. **Testing:** Each prisoner takes a sip from the bottles corresponding to their assigned 1s in their binary code. For example, a prisoner with code 1010100111 would try wines 1, 3, 6, 8, and 10.\n\n3. **Tracking:** After 12 hours, any prisoner who feels ill reveals their binary code. This information narrows down the poisoned bottle to a specific group of bottles that all share the same 1s in their code.\n\n4. **Repeating:** The remaining prisoners then retest the identified group using the same binary logic, but now with half the options. This process continues every 12 hours, effectively halving the possible poisoned bottles each time.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n* **Efficiency:** This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed, ensuring that the king identifies the poisoned bottle within 24 hours.\n* **Scalability:** This method can be easily adapted for a different number of prisoners or bottles.\n* **Safety:** Each prisoner only tastes a small amount of wine, minimizing the risk of severe poisoning.\n\n**Comparison to other options:**\n\n* **Option A:** Dividing bottles equally wouldn't guarantee identifying the poison within 24 hours.\n* **Option B:** This approach is too risky, as it could potentially kill all the prisoners.\n* **Option C:** This method involves significant risk and wouldn't necessarily identify the poisoned bottle within the timeframe.\n\nTherefore, the optimal solution is D, which utilizes a binary search strategy to efficiently and safely identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
