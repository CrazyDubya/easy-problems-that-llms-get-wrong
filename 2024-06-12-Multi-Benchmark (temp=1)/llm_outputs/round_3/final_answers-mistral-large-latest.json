This strategy allows him to test multiple bottles at once, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nIn this case, the king can label each bottle with a unique binary number of length 10 (since there are 10 prisoners). Each digit in the binary number corresponds to a prisoner. If the digit is 1, the prisoner drinks from the bottle; if the digit is 0, the prisoner does not drink from the bottle. After 24 hours, the king can look at the prisoners who have died and read off the binary number that corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 2, and 8 die, the binary number would be 110000001 in binary, which is 2049 in decimal. Therefore, bottle 2049 would be the poisoned one.\n\nThis method allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing, making it the fastest way.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
