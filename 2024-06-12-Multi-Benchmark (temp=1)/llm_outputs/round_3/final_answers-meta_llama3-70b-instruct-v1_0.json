We can continue this process until we have only one horse left, which is the fastest.\n\nHowever, we can't be sure that the winner of the previous race is actually the fastest overall. For example, in the first race, horse A might be faster than horse B, but horse C might be even faster than horse A.

This means that if you switch to door No. 2, you effectively get to choose between the two remaining doors, one of which has a 2\/3 chance of having the gold bar.\n\nSo, by switching to door No. 2, you increase your chances of winning the gold bar from 1\/3 to 2\/3.\n\nHere's the answer in JSON format:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

With 10 prisoners, we can represent each bottle of wine as a binary number with 10 digits (2^10 = 1024, which is greater than 1000). Each prisoner can be assigned a binary digit (0 or 1) to test a specific set of bottles.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n\n1. Assign each prisoner a binary digit (0 or 1) to test a specific set of bottles. For example, prisoner 1 tests bottles 1-512 (binary 0000000001), prisoner 2 tests bottles 1-256 and 513-768 (binary 0000000010), and so on.\n2. Have each prisoner drink the assigned set of wines.\n3.

Since they are twins, they must have the same birthday, so the probability of at least two people having the same birthday is 100% with just one pair of twins.\n\nNow, let's consider a room with more than one pair of twins. The key insight here is that we don't need to worry about the twins themselves having the same birthday, but rather the probability that any two people in the room share a birthday.\n\nThe probability that two people have different birthdays is 364\/365, since there are 365 possible birthdays and we're assuming that the birthdays are independent and uniformly distributed.\n\nThe probability that all pairs of people have different birthdays is then (364\/365)^(number of pairs). We want to find the smallest number of pairs such that this probability is less than or equal to 0.5.\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute the probability, we find that with 23 pairs of twins (D), the probability that all pairs have different birthdays is approximately 0.493, which is less than 0.5.
