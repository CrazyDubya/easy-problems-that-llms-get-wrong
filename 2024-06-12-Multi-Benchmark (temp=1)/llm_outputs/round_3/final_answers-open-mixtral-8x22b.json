Here's a way to do it in just three races:\n\nRace 1: Divide the six horses into two groups of three and race each group. The winners of each race advance to the final race, and the remaining horses are out of contention. Number of races so far: 2\n\nRace 2: Race the two horses that lost the first race but had the fastest times against each other. The winner moves on to the final race. Number of races so far: 3\n\nRace 3: The final race is between the two horses that won their respective first races, and the winner of the second race. The fastest horse out of these three is the fastest overall. Number of races: 4\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the minimum number of races needed to determine the fastest horse, we can actually complete this in just three races. In the first pair of races, select the two winners to advance to the final race. Then, in the second pair of races, race the remaining four horses in two races of two horses each. The winners of these races are each placed third and fourth, leaving only two horses that have not been eliminated.\n\nThus, the minimum number of races needed to determine the fastest horse is three.

This involves dividing the bottles into groups, and having the prisoners drink from specific groups to isolate the poisoned bottle.\n\nHere's how it will work:\n\nDivide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100. Number the groups 0 to 9. Then, have the first prisoner take a sip from the bottles in groups 0-9, except for group 0. After 24 hours, if the prisoner is alive, we know the poisoned bottle is in group 0. If the prisoner is dead, we know the poisoned bottle is in one of the groups 1-9. Depending on the outcome, we can continue this process with the remaining prisoners to isolate the poisoned bottle.\n\nSo, the correct answer is D.
