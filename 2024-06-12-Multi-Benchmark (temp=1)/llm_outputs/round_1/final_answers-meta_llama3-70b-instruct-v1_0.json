Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"Here's my explanation and answer:\n\nThe key to this problem is to realize that we don't need to consider pairs of twins, but rather the total number of people in the room. The question is asking for the minimum number of people needed to have at least a 50% chance that two people share the same birthday.\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are evenly distributed across the 365 possible days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n\nFor a single person, the probability of having a specific birthday is 1\/365. For two people, the probability that they have the same birthday is 1\/365, and the probability that they don't have the same birthday is 364\/365.\n\nFor three people, the probability that at least two people share a birthday is higher than for two people. We can calculate this probability by considering the complementary event: the probability that all three people have different birthdays. This probability is (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 (362\/365). The probability that at least two people share a birthday is then 1 - (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 (362\/365).\n\nWe can continue this process for larger numbers of people. Using a calculator or computer, we find that the smallest number of people needed to have at least a 50% chance of two people sharing a birthday is 23.\n\nSince each pair of twins consists of two people, we need 23 people, which means we need 23\/2 = 11.5 pairs of twins.
