He should number the bottles from 1 to 1000 and express each number in binary using 10 digits (prisoners). Each prisoner is assigned a digit position. Prisoners sample wine from bottles where their assigned digit is 1. After 24 hours, the king can identify the poisoned bottle based on which prisoners die, since the positions of the dead prisoners will correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle's number.

In a room with no twins, the probability of no two people sharing the same birthday is given by the formula:\n\n   P(no match) = 1 * (364\/365) * (363\/365) * ... * (365-n+1)\/365\n\n   where n is the number of people in the room.\n\n2. With twins, each pair of twins is guaranteed to have the same birthday. So, we can treat each pair of twins as a single entity when calculating the probability.\n\n3. We want to find the smallest number of pairs of twins such that the probability of no two entities (pairs of twins or individuals) sharing the same birthday is less than 50%. In other words, we want P(no match) < 0.5.\n\n4. Let's try different numbers of pairs of twins:\n\n   - 1 pair of twins: P(no match) = 1 * (364\/365) \u2248 0.997 > 0.5\n   - 12 pairs of twins: P(no match) = 1 * (364\/365) * ... * (353\/365) \u2248 0.529 > 0.5\n   - 23 pairs of twins: P(no match) = 1 * (364\/365) * ... * (342\/365) \u2248 0.493 < 0.5\n\n5.
