First, divide the horses into two groups of three and have each group race. This will take two races.\n2. The winner of each of these races is guaranteed to be among the top three fastest horses. Let's call them Horse A and Horse B. Now, perform a third race with the second-place horses from the two initial races, as well as the fastest remaining horse that hasn't been considered for the top three yet. This ensures that every horse has a fair chance.\n3. The winner and second-place finisher of Race 3 will be, respectively, the third- and second-fastest horses overall (since they've beaten the slower second-place horse of Race 1 or Race 2). To determine the fastest horse, conduct a final race between the current fastest horses, Horse A and Horse B.\n\nIn total, three races are sufficient to find the fastest horse with this strategy.

In this scenario, after you've made your initial choice (door No. 1), the host, who knows what's behind each door, offers you a chance to switch to another door (door No. 2).\n\nHere's the key point: The host will always offer you the chance to switch and will never open the door you initially chose.

When your opponent fires the gun and no bullet comes out, it means the chamber was empty. Since the gun has six chambers and five bullets, there was initially a 1\/6 chance that the first chamber was empty. When it turns out to be empty, the probability doesn't change for the next shot - it's still a 1 in 6 chance that the next chamber is empty, because there are still five bullets in the gun and one empty chamber, and you don't know where the empty chamber is.\n\nSpinning the chamber again doesn't change the probability because the bullet distribution is already randomized. The misconception here is that not spinning would mean you're \"taking the next chamber\" which people often think would have a higher chance of being a bullet since the last one was empty.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"The fastest way to identify the poisoned bottle is to use a binary search strategy, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. This way, the king will be able to know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's an explanation of how this method works:\n\nEach prisoner will be assigned to represent one binary digit (0 or 1) in a 10-digit binary number. The bottles of wine will be numbered from 0 to 1023 (since 10 binary digits can represent numbers up to 1023). This method allows testing up to 1024 bottles, which is more than the 1000 bottles the king has.\n\nFor each round of testing, give a sip of wine to a prisoner depending on the corresponding binary digit of the bottle's number. If a prisoner dies, it means that the binary digit they represented for the poisoned bottle was a 1. If a prisoner survives, it means that the binary digit was a 0.\n\nBy doing this, the king can identify the poisoned wine bottle within 24 hours since the poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
