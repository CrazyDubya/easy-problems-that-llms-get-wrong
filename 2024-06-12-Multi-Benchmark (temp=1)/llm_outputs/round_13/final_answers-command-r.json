With two people in a room, the chance of them having the same birthday is 1\/365 * 1\/365 = 1\/133,225.\n\nTo get to a 50% chance, we can use the formula for compound probability:\nP(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)\n\nWe can interpret having the same birthday as event A and the second person's birthday being the same as event B.\nP(both events happen) = P(A) * P(B) = (1\/365) * (1\/365) = 1\/133,225\n\nWe need a total of 133,224\/365 = 364 people with different birthdays in the room.
