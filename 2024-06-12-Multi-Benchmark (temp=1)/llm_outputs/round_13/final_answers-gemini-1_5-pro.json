The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nC. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"C\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is C and the reasoning behind it:\n\n* **The Problem:** The key is to identify a single poisoned bottle out of 1000 within 24 hours.\n\n* **Why A, B, and D are incorrect:**\n    * **A:**  Tasting the poison is not a reliable method. Even a small amount could be lethal.\n    * **B:** This is highly inefficient and would require 10,000 tastings (10 prisoners x 1000 bottles). \n    * **D:**  Similar to A, this is dangerous and unethical. Additionally, with only one poisoned bottle, it's likely no prisoners would die within the 24-hour window making this strategy ineffective.\n\n* **Why C is correct:**\n    * **Binary Search:** This is the most efficient way to narrow down a search within a set of possibilities. Here's how it works:\n        1. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n        2. **Number the Bottles:**  Assign each bottle a binary number from 0000000001 (1) to 1111101000 (1000).\n        3. **Give Wine Based on Binary:** Each prisoner drinks from bottles where their corresponding binary digit is a '1'. For example:\n            * Prisoner 1 drinks from bottles with a '1' in the rightmost digit of their binary representation (1, 3, 5, 7...999)\n            * Prisoner 2 drinks from bottles with a '1' in the second digit from the right (2, 3, 6, 7...1000) and so on.\n        4. **Observe After 24 Hours:** Create a binary number based on which prisoners die. A '1' represents a dead prisoner, '0' a living one.  This binary number will directly correspond to the poisoned bottle.\n\n    * **Efficiency:** Binary search allows you to test 1000 bottles with just 10 prisoners.  Each prisoner represents a 'bit' in a binary number, and 2^10 = 1024, exceeding the number of bottles. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is because we're looking at the probability of *any* two people sharing a birthday, not one specific person. \\n\\n* **Twins and the Paradox:** When dealing with pairs of twins, we essentially double the chances of a shared birthday.  Since 23 people creates a greater than 50% chance, we can roughly assume that half that number of twin pairs would be needed to achieve a similar probability. \\n\\n* **Important Note:** This is a simplification. The actual probability calculation is more complex because we're dealing with guaranteed shared birthdays within a pair.
