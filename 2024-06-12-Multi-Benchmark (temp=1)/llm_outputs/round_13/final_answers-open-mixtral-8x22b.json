If you were to conduct three races, you would still not have enough data to definitively determine the fastest horse, as some horses would not have raced against each other.

This can be achieved using a tournament-style bracket where horses are paired up for several elimination races, followed by a final race between the winners of each heat. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Conduct 3 races with 2 horses each (Horse A vs. Horse B, Horse C vs. Horse D, Horse E vs. Horse F) - this will give you 3 winners.\n2.

Since the average speed of walking to the friend's house is already known to be 3mph, we need to calculate the speed of running back such that the overall average speed is doubled (i.e., 6mph).\n\nLet's denote the running speed as R (in mph). The average speed for the entire trip would be the harmonic mean of walking and running speeds. It's calculated as follows:\n\nAverage speed = (2 * Walking speed * Running speed) \/ (Walking speed + Running speed)\n\nWe know that the target average speed is 6mph. So, we set up the equation:\n\n6 = (2 * 3 * R) \/ (3 + R)\n\nSolving for R:\n\n6 * (3 + R) = 6 * R\n18 + 6R = 6R\n18 = 6R - 6R + R\n18 = R\n\nThus, the running speed R would need to be 18mph to double the average speed for the entire trip.
