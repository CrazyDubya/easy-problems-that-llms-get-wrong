You initially pick door number 1, and the host offers you the option to switch to door number 2. To determine the choice with the highest advantage, let's analyze the situation:\n\n**Initial Choice:**\n\n- You choose door number 1. \n- The probability of the gold bar being behind door 1 is 1\/3, and behind each of the remaining doors (2 and 3) is 1\/3 each.\n\n**Host's Offer:**\n\n- The host knows where the gold bar is located.\n- By offering you to switch to door 2, the host is essentially revealing information about the location of the gold bar.\n\n**Scenario Analysis:**\n\n1. **Gold bar is behind door 1:**\n    - If you stick with door 1, you win. \n    - If you switch to door 2, you lose.\n\n2. **Gold bar is behind door 2:**\n    - If you stick with door 1, you lose.\n    - If you switch to door 2, you win.\n\n3. **Gold bar is behind door 3:**\n    - If you stick with door 1, you lose.\n    - If you switch to door 2, you still lose.\n\n**Decision and Advantage:**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can see that:\n\n- If the gold bar is behind door 1 or 2, switching to door 2 guarantees a win.\n- If the gold bar is behind door 3, both choices result in a loss.\n\nTherefore, by switching to door 2, you double your chances of winning from 1\/3 (staying with door 1) to 2\/3.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nThe choice with the biggest advantage is to **switch to door number 2 (D)**. By doing so, you leverage the information revealed by the host's offer and significantly increase your probability of winning the gold bar. \n\n**JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n``` \n","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Testing each bottle on a separate prisoner would require 1000 tests, exceeding the 24-hour timeframe.\n* **B:** This approach is unnecessarily cruel and wouldn't provide results within 24 hours. It would take an entire day for the poison to take effect, leaving no time to identify the specific bottle.\n\n**Why C is the best option:**\n\n* **Binary Search:** This method strategically divides the bottles into groups based on binary representation. Each prisoner is assigned a unique binary code and tastes a corresponding set of bottles. \n* **Efficient Testing:** With 10 prisoners, we can test a maximum of 1024 combinations (2^10). This exceeds the 1000 bottles, allowing for complete testing within 24 hours.\n* **Identifying the Poison:** By analyzing which prisoners are affected and their assigned binary codes, the poisoned bottle can be pinpointed through the unique combination that resulted in poisoning.\n\n**Therefore, the answer is:** \n\n```json\n{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"C\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
