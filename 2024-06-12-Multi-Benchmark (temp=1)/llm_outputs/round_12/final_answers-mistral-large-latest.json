If you race them in pairs, you would need three races, but then you would only know the fastest in each pair, not overall.\n\nHere's a strategy to find the fastest horse in three races:\n\n1. First, divide the six horses into two groups of three. Race the two groups separately. This will give you the fastest horse from each group. Let's call them H1 and H2.\n2. Next, race H1 and H2 against each other. The winner of this race is the fastest horse overall.\n3. However, the second fastest horse could be either the loser of the second race (between H1 and H2) or the second fastest horse from the original groups. To determine this, race the second fastest horses from the original groups (let's call them H3 and H4). The winner of this race is the second fastest horse overall if it's faster than the loser of the second race (between H1 and H2).\n\nSo, the minimum number of races needed is three.\n\nHere's your answer in JSON format:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"2":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a gold bar; behind the others, rotten vegetables.

Option C is also not feasible, as it would kill all the prisoners without a certain outcome.\n\nThe best approach is using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners and the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. In this case, each prisoner is assigned to represent a binary digit. The king can label the bottles from 0 to 1000 in binary (0000000000 to 1111111111).\n\nAfter giving a unique combination of bottles to each prisoner and waiting 24 hours, the king will know which prisoners had the poisoned bottles based on who becomes ill. By analyzing the binary combinations associated with the sick prisoners, the king can identify the poisoned bottle's unique number (and thus the bottle itself).\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 7 get sick, the poisoned bottle will have a binary number 101, which corresponds to decimal 5.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
