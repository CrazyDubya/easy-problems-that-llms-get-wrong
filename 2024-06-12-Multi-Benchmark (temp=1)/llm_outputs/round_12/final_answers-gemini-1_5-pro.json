Here's how it applies:\n\n1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10. Convert each prisoner's number into its binary equivalent (e.g., Prisoner 1 is 001, Prisoner 2 is 010, Prisoner 3 is 011, etc.).\n\n2. **Labeling Bottles:**  Label each bottle with a number from 1 to 1000.  Convert each bottle's number into its binary equivalent (up to 10 digits since 2^10 = 1024).\n\n3. **Tasting Strategy:** Each prisoner drinks from bottles where the bottle's binary representation has a '1' in the position corresponding to the prisoner's assigned binary number. \n    * For example: Bottle 5 (binary 0000000101) would be drunk by prisoners 1 and 3.\n\n4. **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, observe which prisoners have died. Create a binary number where:\n    * '1' represents a dead prisoner.\n    * '0' represents a living prisoner.\n\n   This resulting binary number will be the decimal label of the poisoned bottle.\n\n**Example:**\n\nLet's say prisoners 1 and 3 die. This forms the binary code 011, which converts to the decimal number 3. Therefore, bottle number 3 is poisoned.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A & C:**  These methods are inefficient and would likely result in the death of all prisoners.\n* **B:** The poison is stated as bitter, but the king needs a method that guarantees finding the bottle even if the poison is tasteless.\n\n**Binary search is the fastest and most reliable method, ensuring the identification of the poisoned bottle with the minimum number of prisoners at risk.** \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
