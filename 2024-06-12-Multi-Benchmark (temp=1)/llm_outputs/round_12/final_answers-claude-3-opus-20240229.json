In the first race, pair up the horses and race them against each other (3 pairs, 3 races). Take the 3 winners of those races and race them against each other in a final race.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"Here is my explanation and answer in JSON format:\n\nExplanation: This is a version of the famous \"Monty Hall problem\". Initially, you have a 1\/3 probability of picking the correct door with the gold bar. The host then opens one of the other doors that always contains rotten vegetables. The host is giving you the option to switch to the remaining unopened door.\n\nThe key insight is that switching doors will give you a 2\/3 probability of winning the gold bar. This is because the door the host opened depends on which door you initially picked. If you initially picked a door with rotten vegetables (2\/3 chance), the host is forced to open the other rotten vegetable door, so switching will give you the gold bar. If you initially picked the gold bar door (1\/3 chance), then switching will give you rotten vegetables. So switching has a 2\/3 probability of winning, while staying only has a 1\/3 chance.\n\nTherefore, you should always switch doors when given the chance, as it doubles your probability of winning the gold bar.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

The previous empty chamber could end up anywhere after spinning.\n\nHowever, if you do not spin, the empty chamber that your opponent just hit will be in the next position after the one he fired on. So when you pull the trigger without spinning, you are guaranteed to hit the empty chamber and survive.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to not spin the cylinder again before firing.

This allows testing up to 2^10 = 1024 bottles with 10 prisoners, covering the 1000 bottles. After 24 hours, the poisoned bottle can be determined from the binary number formed by which prisoners die.\",\n  \"ANSWER\": \"D\"\n}\n\nThe key is to efficiently divide the testing among the prisoners to minimize total tests needed. A binary search does this optimally. Each prisoner is assigned a digit in a 10-bit binary number. They drink from bottles whose number has a 1 in their assigned binary digit. After 24 hours, the binary number of the poisoned bottle is formed by the digits corresponding to the prisoners who died. This tests all 1000 bottles in parallel using the 10 prisoners.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
