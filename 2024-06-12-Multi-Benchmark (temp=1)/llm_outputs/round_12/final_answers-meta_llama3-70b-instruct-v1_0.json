Now, observe the bulbs. One bulb will be on, one will be off, and one will be off but still warm (because LEDs don't get warm, this option is actually incorrect, but it's the closest to the correct approach).

We want to find the minimum number of pairs of twins needed for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n2. Since each pair of twins has two people, we can consider each pair as a single unit. So, we need to find the minimum number of people (not pairs) required to reach this probability.\n3. The key insight is that we're not looking for the probability of two specific people sharing a birthday, but rather the probability that at least two people out of the total number of people share a birthday.\n4. Let's assume we have n people in the room. The probability that all n people have different birthdays is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365), since each person's birthday is independent of the others.\n5. We want to find the smallest n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is \u2265 50%. This means the probability of all n people having different birthdays should be \u2264 50%.\n6. Using a calculator or approximation, we find that when n = 23, the probability of all 23 people having different birthdays is approximately 49.3%, which is less than 50%. This means that with 23 people, the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is \u2265 50%.\n\nNow, let's convert this back to pairs of twins. Since each pair has two people, we need 23 \/ 2 = 11.5 pairs of twins. Since we can't have a fraction of a pair, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 12 pairs.\n\nHowever, the correct answer is not among the options.

You ask each current guest to move to the room number n*2.\n\nHere's why: if each current guest moves to the room number n*2, then all the odd-numbered rooms will be empty. Since the number of guests is finite (even though the number of rooms is infinite), this will free up an infinite number of odd-numbered rooms.
