Door No. 2:**\n\n* If the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 (which you initially picked), switching to Door No. 2 guarantees you the gold bar.\n* If the gold bar is behind one of the other doors (say Door No. 3), then switching to Door No. 2 results in rotten vegetables.\n\n**B.

It guarantees the gold bar if it was initially behind Door No. 1 and gives you a 50% chance if it was behind one of the other doors.\n* **Door No. 3:** This option offers a 50% chance of winning only if the gold bar is initially behind Door No. 2. In other scenarios, it leads to rotten vegetables.\n* **Sticking with Door No. 1:** This choice maintains your initial 1\/3 probability of winning.\n* **Equal Probability:** This assumption ignores the valuable information revealed by the host, who wouldn't offer a switch unless it benefited you.\n\nTherefore, the choice that gives you the biggest advantage is:\n\n**{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}** \n\nBy switching to Door No. 2, you capitalize on the host's knowledge and significantly improve your chances of winning the gold bar compared to the other options. \n","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Turning each switch on one at a time and observing the bulbs.**\n\nHere's the reasoning behind this choice:\n\n* **Method A** allows for the **systematic identification** of each switch-light bulb pair without introducing unnecessary complexity or limitations. By turning on one switch at a time, we can directly observe which bulb illuminates, establishing a clear correspondence. \n* **Method B** is unnecessary as the problem statement specifies the ability to observe the bulbs within the same room. Introducing another room adds an unnecessary step and doesn't provide any benefit.\n* **Method C**, while seemingly logical, presents several issues. Firstly, LED bulbs do not generate significant heat when lit, making it unreliable to determine their state by touch. Secondly, turning off a switch after turning two on would introduce ambiguity, as we wouldn't know which of the initially lit bulbs corresponds to the remaining switch.\n* **Method D** seems efficient at first, but it could lead to confusion if multiple bulbs illuminate simultaneously. Determining the specific switch for each bulb would require additional observation and analysis, making it less efficient than method A.\n\nTherefore, the most effective and straightforward approach is **A.

Each digit in the code represents a sip from a specific bottle: 1 for a sip, and 0 for no sip.\n\n2. **Testing and Observation:** After 24 hours, the king observes which prisoners are alive and which are dead. The dead prisoners indicate the bottles containing poison in their respective binary codes.\n\n3. **Binary Search:** Based on the dead prisoners' codes, the king performs a binary search to identify the common poisoned bottle. He compares the codes, eliminating the unaffected bottles (0s) from consideration and focusing on the bottles associated with 1s in dead prisoners' codes.\n\n4. **Identification:** Through this process of elimination and comparison, the king quickly converges on the specific bottle that is consistently present in the dead prisoners' codes, ultimately revealing the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method efficiently reduces the number of tests required, maximizing the information gained from each prisoner's experience. By leveraging binary logic and strategically assigning sips, the king can identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours, ensuring the event's success.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
