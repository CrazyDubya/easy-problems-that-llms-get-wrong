The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nC. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nD.

Assign each bottle a unique 10-digit binary number, where each digit maps to a prisoner. A 1 means the prisoner drinks from that bottle, a 0 means they don't. After 24 hours, line up the prisoners in order. The pattern of alive (0) and dead (1) prisoners will match the binary number of the poisoned bottle, allowing you to identify it. With 10 prisoners, you can uniquely number up to 1024 bottles, enough for the 1000 bottles of wine. The other options require far too many tests or won't conclusively identify the exact poisoned bottle.\",\n  \"ANSWER\": \"C\"\n}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
