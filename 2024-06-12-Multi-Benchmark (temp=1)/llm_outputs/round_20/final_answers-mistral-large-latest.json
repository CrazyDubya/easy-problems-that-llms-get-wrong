In this scenario, after you've chosen Door No. 1, the host, who knows what's behind each door, will always open another door to reveal rotten vegetables.

Initially, the probability of the gold bar being behind each door is 1\/3.\n2. When the host reveals rotten vegetables behind one of the other two doors (say, Door No. 3), the probability that the gold bar is behind the remaining unopened door (Door No. 2) increases to 2\/3, while the probability for Door No. 1 remains 1\/3.\n\nThis is because the host's action effectively eliminates one wrong choice, redistributing the initial 2\/3 chance of the gold bar being behind either Door No. 2 or No. 3 to Door No. 2 only.\n\nTherefore, given the opportunity to switch your choice, you should choose Door No. 2 to maximize your chances of winning the gold bar.\n\nThe answer in JSON format is: {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nC. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is to use a binary search strategy. This strategy is based on the concept of binary numbers, where each digit can be either 0 or 1. In this case, each prisoner can be considered a digit, and each bottle of wine can be represented by a unique binary number of length 10 (since there are 10 prisoners).\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Assign each prisoner a position in the binary number, from the most significant digit (leftmost) to the least significant digit (rightmost).\n2. For each bottle of wine, assign a binary number based on its position. For example, the first bottle would be 0000000001, the second bottle would be 0000000010, the third bottle would be 0000000011, and so on, up to the thousandth bottle, which would be 1111101000.\n3. Give each prisoner a sip of wine from the bottles where their corresponding digit in the binary number is 1. For example, if a bottle has the binary number 0101010101, then the first, third, fifth, seventh, and ninth prisoners would take a sip from that bottle.\n\nAfter 24 hours, the king can look at the prisoners who have died to identify the poisoned bottle. Each dead prisoner corresponds to a 1 in the binary number, and each living prisoner corresponds to a 0. This way, the king can identify the poisoned bottle in just 24 hours, regardless of its position among the 1000 bottles.\n\nSo, the answer is C. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours.\n\nReturning in JSON format:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
