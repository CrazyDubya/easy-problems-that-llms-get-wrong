By revealing that one of the remaining doors (let's say No. 3) has rotten vegetables, the host eliminates one losing option.\n3. **Updated Probability:** After the host's reveal, the remaining unopened door (No. 2) now inherits the 2\/3 probability that the gold bar was initially behind either Door No. 2 or No. 3. This means Door No. 2 has a 2\/3 chance of containing the gold bar, while Door No. 1 remains at its initial 1\/3 probability.\n4. **Switching Doors:** Therefore, by switching from Door No. 1 to Door No. 2, you double your chances of winning the gold bar.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **A.

Here's the explanation:\n\n1. **First Crossing:** The fastest person, A (1 minute), crosses alone with the torch. This takes 1 minute.\n2. **Second Crossing:** The next fastest person, B (2 minutes), follows A with the torch. A returns alone, taking another 2 minutes.

This takes 10 + 2 = 12 minutes.\n\nAdding up the time for each crossing, the total time is 1 + 4 + 7 + 12 = 24 minutes. However, we can optimize this further by realizing that A doesn't need to return alone in the third crossing. Instead, B can return with the torch while C is crossing, saving 2 minutes. This brings the total time down to 1 + 4 + 5 + 12 = 22 minutes.\n\nHowever, we can squeeze out even more efficiency. In the final crossing, instead of A and D crossing together, B can go with D, as B is faster. This cuts the final crossing time down to 5 minutes (instead of 12 minutes).\n\nTherefore, the **fastest possible time** for the group to cross the bridge is 1 + 4 + 5 + 5 = **17 minutes**.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **C. 17 minutes**. \n\nHere's the JSON format response:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"} \n``` \n","score":""},"15":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You're in a room with two doors that lead out.

This method minimizes the number of tests required and guarantees a solution within the time constraint. \n\nHere's the explanation:\n\n1. **Label the bottles**: Assign a unique binary code (e.g., 000, 001, 010, ...) to each of the 1000 bottles. \n\n2. **Divide the bottles**:  Distribute the bottles among the 10 prisoners, ensuring each prisoner receives a unique combination of bottles based on their binary codes. For example:\n    - Prisoner 1: Bottles 000, 010, 100, 110 (all bottles with the first digit as 0)\n    - Prisoner 2: Bottles 001, 011, 101, 111 (all bottles with the first digit as 1)\n\n3. **Monitor the prisoners**: Observe the prisoners for 24 hours. If a prisoner shows symptoms of poisoning, identify the common bottle shared among all the poisoned prisoners. This bottle will be the culprit.\n\n4. **Repeat with remaining bottles**: If no prisoner exhibits symptoms, the poison is in the remaining 500 bottles. Repeat the process with these bottles, dividing them again based on their binary code and assigning them to the prisoners. \n\n5. **Continue halving**: Keep repeating the process of dividing the remaining bottles and assigning them to the prisoners based on their binary codes. With each round, the number of bottles to be tested is halved.\n\nFollowing this strategy, it will take a maximum of **10 rounds (2^10 = 1024)** to identify the poisoned bottle, well within the 24-hour timeframe. This method is efficient as it utilizes the binary system to eliminate a large number of bottles with each test, minimizing the total number of tastings required.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Probability of No Shared Birthdays:**\n\nFor each pair of twins, the probability of them not sharing a birthday with any other individual (including their twin) is 364\/365 (since there are 364 remaining days after their birthday). For two pairs of twins, the probability becomes (364\/365) * (363\/365) * (362\/365) * (361\/365), and so on.\n\n**2. Minimum Number of Pairs for 50% Chance:**\n\nWe need to find the number of pairs (n) where the probability of **no shared birthdays** is less than or equal to 0.5.
