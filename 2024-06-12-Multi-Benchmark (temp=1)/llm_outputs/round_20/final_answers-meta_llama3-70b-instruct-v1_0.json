Even if I do multiple races with three horses each, I still won't be able to determine the overall fastest horse.\n\nTo solve this problem, I can use a strategy called \"tournament design\" or \"round-robin tournament\".

This is because the chambers are not shuffled again, so the probability of each chamber being empty is not equal.\n\nOn the other hand, if we spin the chambers again, the probability of each chamber being empty becomes 1\/6, since the chambers are shuffled again and each chamber has an equal probability of being empty.\n\nSince 1\/5 is less than 1\/6, it is better not to spin the chambers again.

Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Assign a unique binary number (0-1023) to each bottle of wine.\n2. Divide the 10 prisoners into two groups: 5 prisoners will test the \"odd\" bottles (1, 3, 5, ..., 1023) and 5 prisoners will test the \"even\" bottles (0, 2, 4, ..., 1022).\n3. After 24 hours, if more prisoners die in the \"odd\" group, the poisoned bottle is one of the odd-numbered bottles. If more prisoners die in the \"even\" group, the poisoned bottle is one of the even-numbered bottles.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 with the remaining prisoners, dividing the suspected bottles into two groups (e.g., \"odd-odd\" and \"odd-even\" or \"even-odd\" and \"even-even\").\n5. Continue this process until only one bottle remains.\n\nWith 10 prisoners, the king can identify the poisoned bottle in at most 10 iterations (2^10 = 1024). Since each iteration takes 24 hours, the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's not the fastest way and would require a large number of prisoners. Option B is incorrect because the poison takes effect after 24 hours, so the prisoners wouldn't be able to taste the bitterness. Option D is incorrect because it's similar to option A and not the most efficient approach.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
