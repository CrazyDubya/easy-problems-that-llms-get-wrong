This puzzle is based on the Monty Hall problem. Here\u2019s a detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - There are 3 doors: Door 1, Door 2, and Door 3.\n   - Behind one of these doors is a gold bar, and behind the other two are rotten vegetables.\n   - You pick a door, say Door 1.\n\n2. **Host\u2019s Action:**\n   - The host, knowing what is behind each door, will always create a situation that gives you a choice between your initial pick and another door, by revealing a rotten vegetable behind one of the remaining doors not chosen by you.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - If you initially pick Door 1, there are three possible scenarios:\n     - Scenario 1: Gold is behind Door 1 (1\/3 chance).\n     - Scenario 2: Gold is behind Door 2 (1\/3 chance).\n     - Scenario 3: Gold is behind Door 3 (1\/3 chance).\n   - The host will then reveal a door with rotten vegetables among the remaining two doors.\n     - If the gold is behind your initial pick (1\/3 chance), staying with your initial choice wins.\n     - If the gold is behind one of the other two doors (2\/3 chance), switching will win, because the host will open a door with rotten vegetables.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - When you initially pick Door 1, the probability of winning by staying with Door 1 is 1\/3.\n   - The probability of winning by switching to another door (in this case, Door 2 as given in the problem) is 2\/3.\n\nThus, switching doors gives you a higher probability of winning.

Hence, the chamber that fired is the one and only empty chamber, or another chamber with a bullet didn't align and the empty one is still there.\n\nWhen analyzing the situation if you do not spin again:\n- Since your opponent did not get a bullet, the remaining chambers now include the single empty chamber and four filled chambers. \n- Given there are only remaining 5 chambers, the probability of you firing the next round (right after your opponent) into that empty chamber is 1\/5.\n\nIf you spin again:\n- If you spin again, you reset the probability to its initial state, which means that there's 1 empty chamber and 5 loaded chambers out of 6.\n- The chance of the next chamber being empty is 1\/6 when you reset by spinning.\n\nIn summary:\n- Not spinning gives you a 1\/5 chance of survival (0.20).\n- Spinning again gives you a 1\/6 chance of survival (approximately 0.167).\n\nTherefore, it is better to not spin the chambers again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

This takes 1 minute.\n   \n   Total time so far: 2 + 1 = 3 minutes.\n\n3. **Step 3:** C and D cross the bridge together with the torch. This takes 10 minutes (the time for D, the slower of the two).\n4. **Step 4:** B returns with the torch.

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**:\n    Each bottle can be uniquely identified by a number from 0 to 999 (since there are 1000 bottles).\n    In binary, 1000 can be represented using 10 bits (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\)).\n\n2. **Assign Bottles to Prisoners**:\n    Each of the 10 prisoners represents a bit in the 10-bit binary number. If a bit is set (1), that prisoner will drink from that bottle. If a bit is not set (0), the prisoner will not drink from that bottle.\n\n    For example, bottle 5 in binary is 0000000101. So prisoners 1 and 3 (if we count from 0) will drink from this bottle because those positions are 1s in the binary representation of 5.\n\n3. **Identify the Poisoned Bottle**:\n    After 24 hours, check which prisoners have died. The combination of which prisoners are dead will form a unique binary number, directly corresponding to the index of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method will need only one round of testing, which fits the requirement of identifying the poisoned bottle in 24 hours.

Slightly higher than 0.5m: This makes sense because it acknowledges the need to jump just enough to clear the hurdle.\n- C. Between 0.1m and 0.5m: This is incorrect since jumping below the hurdle's height (0.5m) would not allow him to clear it.\n- D. 0.5m: This is not sufficient because he needs to jump slightly higher to actually avoid touching the hurdle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"30":{"category":"Popular science","question":"I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.
