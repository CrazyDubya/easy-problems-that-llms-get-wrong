If we ask the liar a question, they will give us a false answer.\n\nThe key insight here is that we don't need to ask a question about which door leads to freedom or death. Instead, we can ask a question that will allow us to eliminate one of the doors, regardless of who we ask.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n\n1. Choose one of the guardians and ask them, \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible responses:\n\n* If the truth-teller is asked, they will tell us what the liar would say, which would be a false answer. So, if they point to a door, we know that door leads to death.\n* If the liar is asked, they will lie about what the truth-teller would say. So, if they point to a door, we know that door leads to death.\n\nIn either case, we can safely assume the opposite door leads to freedom.\n\nThis means we only need to ask **one question** to determine which door leads to freedom.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

We need to use a strategy that minimizes the number of tests needed to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nOption B and D are not feasible because they would require a large number of tests, and we wouldn't be able to identify the poisoned bottle within the 24-hour time frame. Option C is also not possible because the poison takes effect after 24 hours, so the prisoners wouldn't be able to taste the bitterness immediately.\n\nOption A is the correct answer because it uses a binary search strategy, which is an efficient way to search for a specific item in a large dataset. By using binary numbers, we can represent each bottle of wine as a binary sequence of 0s and 1s, where each prisoner corresponds to a specific digit in the sequence.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Assign each prisoner a binary number from 0 to 9 (0000 to 1001 in binary).\n2. Each prisoner drinks a mixture of wines corresponding to their binary number. For example, prisoner 0 (0000) drinks a mixture of wines 1-8, prisoner 1 (0001) drinks a mixture of wines 1-4 and 9-16, and so on.\n3. After 24 hours, the prisoners who die indicate which bottles of wine contain the poison.\n4.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"Here's my explanation and answer:\n\nThe key to this problem is to realize that we don't need to find the number of pairs of twins, but rather the total number of people in the room. The reason is that we want to find the minimum number of people required for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people share the same birthday.\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity). For a single person, the probability of having a birthday on any given day is 1\/365.\n\nNow, let's add a second person to the room. The probability that the second person has a different birthday than the first person is 364\/365, since there are 364 remaining days that are different from the first person's birthday.\n\nAs we add more people to the room, the probability that all of them have different birthdays decreases. For example, with three people, the probability that all three have different birthdays is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365).\n\nTo find the minimum number of people required for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people share the same birthday, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Calculate the probability that all people have different birthdays for a given number of people.\n2. Find the smallest number of people for which this probability is less than or equal to 50%.\n\nUsing this approach, we find that with 23 people in the room, the probability that all of them have different birthdays is approximately 49.3%, which is less than 50%. Therefore, with 23 people, there is at least a 50% chance that two people share the same birthday.\n\nSince we need 23 people in the room, and each pair of twins consists of 2 people, we don't need to count the number of pairs. Instead, we can simply divide 23 by 2 to find the number of pairs, which is approximately 11.5 pairs. However, since we can't have a fraction of a pair, we can ignore this calculation and focus on the total number of people.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I choose:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

At first glance, it seems impossible to accommodate one more guest in a fully booked infinite hotel. However, the key insight is that the hotel has an infinite number of rooms.\n\nOption C is the correct answer. Here's how it works: suppose the current guests are occupying rooms 1, 2, 3, ..., n. To accommodate one more guest, you ask each current guest to move to the room number n*2. This means the guest in room 1 moves to room 2, the guest in room 2 moves to room 4, the guest in room 3 moves to room 6, and so on.\n\nThis process creates a vacant room 1, which can now be occupied by the new guest. This solution works because the hotel has an infinite number of rooms, so there's always room to move the existing guests to accommodate one more.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n\nA.
