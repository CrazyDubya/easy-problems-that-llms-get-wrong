With one pair of twins, the likelihood of them having the same birthday is 1\/365, which is far less than 50%. \n\nTo get a 50% chance, we'd need to increase the number of combinations of twins' birthdays.

When the tree grew to 3kg, the mass of the pot and soil remained the same, as nothing was added or removed. Therefore, the amount of soil left is 10kg - 3kg = 7kg.
