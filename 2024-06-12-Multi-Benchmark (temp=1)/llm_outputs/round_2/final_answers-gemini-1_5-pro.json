The king will know results in 24 hours","Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    The Poisoned Wine - A king has 1000 sweet bottles of wine, and one contains a very bitter poison. The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nC. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **A and B are incorrect**  because these methods would likely kill all the prisoners. \n* **D is incorrect** because the poison takes 24 hours to take effect, so tasting it wouldn't immediately reveal the poisoned bottle.\n\n**C is the correct answer:** Here's how a binary search strategy works in this scenario:\n\n1. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n2. **Number the Bottles:**  Assign each bottle a binary number from 0000000001 (1) to 1111101000 (1000).\n3. **Assign Wine:** Each prisoner drinks from bottles based on their corresponding binary digit. For example:\n   - Prisoner 1 drinks from every bottle where the *last* binary digit is a 1.\n   - Prisoner 2 drinks from every bottle where the *second to last* binary digit is a 1.\n   - ...and so on.\n4. **Observe After 24 Hours:**  Note which prisoners die.  The dead prisoners represent the '1' bits in the poisoned bottle's binary number. For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0001100001 (bottle number 257).\n\n**Why Binary Search Works:** Binary search is highly efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles simultaneously. This method guarantees you'll find the poisoned bottle within the 24-hour timeframe. \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

You need at least one vowel to form a word, and most sentences will require multiple instances of different vowels.\n* **Common Consonants:** Some consonants (like t, n, s, r) are incredibly common and almost impossible to avoid in a sentence.\n\nLet's look at the provided answers:\n\n* **A. 'Dogs bark with me.'**  Repeats 'e', 'o', 'w', and 'i'.\n* **C. 'The five boxers jog quick.'** Repeats 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'c'.\n* **D. 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'**  This famous pangram is designed to use all the letters of the alphabet, meaning it repeats many letters. \n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is B.
