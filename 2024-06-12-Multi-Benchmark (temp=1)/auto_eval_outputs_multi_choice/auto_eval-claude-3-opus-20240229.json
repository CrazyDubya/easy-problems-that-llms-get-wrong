This allows us to test many combinations of wine bottles in parallel using the 10 prisoners.\n\nThe optimal approach is to number the wine bottles from 1 to 1000 and write each number in binary format (which will be 10 digits long for numbers up to 1000). Then, have each prisoner sample the wines corresponding to the bottles where their \"prisoner number\" digit is a 1.  \n\nFor example, Prisoner 1 will sample every bottle with a 1 in the 1's place (odd numbered bottles). Prisoner 2 samples every bottle with a 1 in the 2's place (numbers 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, etc.). This continues up to Prisoner 10 sampling bottles with a 1 in the 10th digit (512, 513, 514, etc.)\n\nAfter 24 hours, by seeing which prisoners have died, the king can determine the binary number corresponding to the single poisoned bottle.

Dividing the 1000 bottles among 10 prisoners would require each prisoner to drink from 100 bottles. This would likely kill all the prisoners and still not definitively identify the single poisoned bottle.\n\nB. A binary search strategy could work well here. Number the bottles 0 to 999 and represent each number as a 10-digit binary number (e.g. bottle 0 is 0000000000, bottle 1 is 0000000001, etc). Have each prisoner take a sip from every bottle that has a 1 in their assigned digit position. After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners that are dead will give you the binary digits of the poisoned bottle number. This requires only 10 sips total, one per prisoner, and will definitively identify the single poisoned bottle.\n\nC. Having all 10 prisoners sample all 1000 bottles would require 10,000 sips total. This is very inefficient and would likely kill all the prisoners from the cumulative effects of the poison.\n\nD. Having the prisoners divide and taste the wine for bitterness would not work, as the question states the poison is very bitter but does not say the wine itself is not also bitter.

Each pair of twins shares the same birthday.\n2. We need to find the number of pairs that gives us a probability of 0.5 or higher for at least one shared birthday among the individuals in the room.\n\nLet's calculate the probability of no shared birthdays and then subtract it from 1 to get the probability of at least one shared birthday.\n\n- With 1 pair of twins (2 individuals), the probability of no shared birthdays is 1 (certainty).\n- With 2 pairs of twins (4 individuals), the probability of no shared birthdays is 1 * (364\/365) = 0.9973.\n- With 3 pairs of twins (6 individuals), the probability of no shared birthdays is 1 * (364\/365) * (363\/365) = 0.9918.\n\nWe can continue this pattern until the probability of no shared birthdays is less than 0.5. \n\nUsing the formula: P(no shared birthdays) = (365\/365) * (364\/365) * (363\/365) * ... * ((365-n+1)\/365), where n is the number of individuals.\n\nAfter calculating, we find that with 23 pairs of twins (46 individuals), the probability of no shared birthdays is approximately 0.4927. This means the probability of at least one shared birthday is 1 - 0.4927 = 0.5073, which is greater than 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of pairs of twins needed in a room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday is 23 pairs.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"234":{"level_0":234,"index":25,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

By diverting the trolley, you would be saving the lives of those five individuals who would otherwise be killed if the trolley continued unimpeded. The act of pulling the lever itself does not directly take anyone's life.\n\nHowever, this is still an ethical dilemma because pulling the lever to save the five means actively choosing to divert the trolley to the other track. If there happened to be a person on that other track, you would be saving the five but causing the death of the one individual. So while your action would have the consequence of saving net lives, you would bear some moral culpability for the death on the other track.

For the first person, the probability is 1 (100%). For the second person, the probability is 364\/365 (assuming no leap years). For the third person, it's 363\/365, and so on.\n\nThe probability of no two people having the same birthday is:\n\nP(no match) = 1 * (364\/365) * (363\/365) * ... * ((365-n+1)\/365)\n\nwhere n is the number of people in the room.\n\nWe want to find the smallest n such that P(no match) \u2264 0.5, or equivalently, P(at least one match) \u2265 0.5.\n\nNow, since we are dealing with pairs of twins, each pair is guaranteed to have the same birthday. So, we can treat each pair as a single entity. In other words, we need to find the number of pairs of twins, not the number of individuals.\n\nLet's try the given options:\n\nA. 46 pairs: This would be 92 individuals, which is more than enough to have a 50% chance of a match.\nB. 12 pairs: This is 24 individuals. The probability of no match is still quite high with 24 people.\nC. 1 pair: With just 2 people, the probability of a match is very low.\nD. 23 pairs: This is 46 individuals. This is close to the well-known \"birthday problem\" where 23 people are needed for a 50% chance of a match.\n\nAfter considering the options, 23 pairs (46 individuals) seems to be the closest to the correct answer.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"294":{"level_0":294,"index":25,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

So pulling the lever has a direct impact on saving the lives of those five individuals.\n\nHowever, the question does not specify whether there are any people on the other track that the trolley would be diverted onto. If there are people on that track, then pulling the lever would endanger their lives instead.

The host is giving you the option to switch to the remaining unopened door.\n\nThe key insight is that switching doors will give you a 2\/3 probability of winning the gold bar. This is because the door the host opened depends on which door you initially picked. If you initially picked a door with rotten vegetables (2\/3 chance), the host is forced to open the other rotten vegetable door, so switching will give you the gold bar. If you initially picked the gold bar door (1\/3 chance), then switching will give you rotten vegetables. So switching has a 2\/3 probability of winning, while staying only has a 1\/3 chance.\n\nTherefore, you should always switch doors when given the chance, as it doubles your probability of winning the gold bar.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"332":{"level_0":332,"index":3,"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nC.

By using a binary search strategy and assigning each prisoner a \"binary digit\", you can uniquely identify up to 2^10 = 1024 bottles with just 10 prisoners. \n\nFor example, label the bottles 0 to 999 and write those numbers in binary. Wherever there is a 1 in the binary representation, have the corresponding prisoner take a sip from that bottle. After 24 hours, see which prisoners died. The binary number formed by the dead prisoners will tell you the number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis allows you to definitively identify the single poisoned bottle within the 24 hour time limit while minimizing the testing.\n\nThe other answers either require more than 24 hours (B, C) or don't conclusively identify the poisoned bottle (D).

This allows you to test multiple bottles on each prisoner.\n\nIf you simply divide the 1000 bottles among the 10 prisoners, as suggested in answers A and C, you would only be able to test 10 bottles total, which is not enough.\n\nAnswer D suggests having all prisoners sample all 1000 bottles, which would definitely kill all the prisoners and not isolate which specific bottle is poisoned.\n\nThe most efficient approach is to use a binary search strategy, as described in answer B. Assign each bottle a unique 10-digit binary number, where each digit maps to a specific prisoner. For example, bottle 0000000001 is only sampled by prisoner 10, bottle 0000000010 is only sampled by prisoner 9, bottle 0000000011 is sampled by prisoners 9 and 10, and so on.\n\nHave each prisoner sample the bottles corresponding to their assigned binary digit. After 24 hours, the prisoners that sampled the poisoned bottle will have died. The binary number represented by the dead prisoners will reveal the bottle number of the poisoned wine.\n\nThis allows you to uniquely identify the poisoned bottle out of 1000 total bottles using only 10 prisoners, and get the result within the 24 hour time limit.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"437":{"level_0":437,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Initially, you have a 1\/3 probability of choosing the correct door with the gold bar. After you make your initial choice of door No. 1, the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens up door No. 3 to show you rotten vegetables. The host then asks if you want to switch to door No. 2.\n\nAt this point, the probability has shifted. Door No. 1 still has a 1\/3 chance of containing the gold bar. But door No. 2 now has a 2\/3 probability, because it includes the 1\/3 chance that door No. 2 originally had, plus the 1\/3 chance from door No. 3 that the host eliminated.\n\nTherefore, by switching to door No. 2, you double your probability of winning the gold bar from 1\/3 to 2\/3.

If we assume the distance to the friend's house is d miles, then the time spent walking there is d\/3 hours. Let's say the running speed back is x mph. The time spent running back would be d\/x hours. To double the average speed, the total time for the round trip should be half of the time it took to walk there one-way:\n\nd\/3 + d\/x = (d\/3) \/ 2\n\nSolving for x:\nd\/x = (d\/3) \/ 2 - d\/3 = d\/6 - d\/3 = -d\/6\nx = -6d\/d = -6 (negative speed is impossible)\n\nThis means no matter how fast you run back, you cannot double your average speed for the entire trip.

Plugging in the values for 1 pair (2 people), 12 pairs (24 people), 23 pairs (46 people), and 46 pairs (92 people):\n   - 1 pair: 1 - e^(-2(2-1)\/(2*365)) \u2248 0.27% (much less than 50%)\n   - 12 pairs: 1 - e^(-24(24-1)\/(2*365)) \u2248 13.86% (still less than 50%)\n   - 23 pairs: 1 - e^(-46(46-1)\/(2*365)) \u2248 50.05% (just above 50%)\n   - 46 pairs: 1 - e^(-92(92-1)\/(2*365)) \u2248 87.66% (well above 50%)\n5. Therefore, the smallest number of pairs needed to have at least a 50% chance of two people having the same birthday is 23 pairs.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"594":{"level_0":594,"index":25,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
