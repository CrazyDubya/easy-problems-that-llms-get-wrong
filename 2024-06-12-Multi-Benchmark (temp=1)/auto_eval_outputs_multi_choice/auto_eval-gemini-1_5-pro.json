For example:\n   - Prisoner 1 drinks from every bottle where the *last* binary digit is a 1.\n   - Prisoner 2 drinks from every bottle where the *second to last* binary digit is a 1.\n   - ...and so on.\n4. **Observe After 24 Hours:**  Note which prisoners die.  The dead prisoners represent the '1' bits in the poisoned bottle's binary number. For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0001100001 (bottle number 257).\n\n**Why Binary Search Works:** Binary search is highly efficient.

Using a binary search strategy**. Here's why:\n\n* **A is incorrect** because it's inefficient and morally reprehensible. It also only provides information about one bottle.\n* **B is incorrect** because the poison is stated to be tasteless (only taking effect after 24 hours).\n* **C is incorrect** because it's impossible for each prisoner to sample 1000 bottles.\n\n**Binary Search Strategy:**\n\n1. **Number the prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n2. **Number the bottles:**  Assign each bottle a binary number from 0000000001 (1) to 1111101000 (1000).\n3. **Assign wine based on binary:**  Each prisoner drinks from bottles where their corresponding binary digit is a \"1\". For example:\n    * Prisoner 1 drinks from every bottle with a \"1\" in the rightmost digit of its binary representation (1, 3, 5, 7...999).\n    * Prisoner 2 drinks from every bottle with a \"1\" in the second digit from the right (2, 3, 6, 7...1000), and so on. \n4. **Observe after 24 hours:**  The prisoners who die represent a \"1\" in their corresponding binary digit. Those who live represent a \"0\".  Construct the binary number from the dead\/alive status of the prisoners. This binary number directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\n**Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0001100001, which translates to bottle number 289.\n\n**Why Binary Search Works:**  This method leverages the power of binary representation.  With 10 prisoners, you can create 2^10 (1024) unique combinations, allowing you to test up to 1024 bottles simultaneously. \n","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"287":{"level_0":287,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
