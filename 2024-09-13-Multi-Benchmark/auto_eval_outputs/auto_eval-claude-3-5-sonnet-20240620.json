The poison takes effect in 24 hours, which is the same timeframe we have to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\n2. We have 10 prisoners available for testing.\n\n3. We need to find a single poisoned bottle out of 1000 bottles.\n\n4. The poison is described as \"very bitter,\" but tasting for bitterness is not reliable as it's subjective and the question states the wine is generally sweet.\n\n5. We need to use the 10 prisoners efficiently to test all 1000 bottles in a single round of testing, as we only have 24 hours.\n\nThe most efficient way to do this is to use a binary system:\n\n1. Assign each bottle a unique 10-digit binary number (0000000000 to 1111101000).\n2. Each prisoner represents one digit in this binary number.\n3. If the digit is 1, the prisoner drinks from that bottle; if it's 0, they don't.\n4. After 24 hours, the king can determine which bottle is poisoned based on which prisoners die.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 7 die, the poisoned bottle would be 1010001000 in binary (640 in decimal).\n\nThis method allows us to test all 1000 bottles in a single round of testing, using only 10 prisoners, and we'll know the result in exactly 24 hours.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"167":{"level_0":167,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

If you don't spin again, you know for certain that the next chamber (which will rotate into firing position) contains a bullet. This gives you a 100% chance of firing a bullet.\n\n4.

Since there are infinite rooms and the hotel is only partially full, there must be empty rooms available.\n- Option C is incorrect because with infinite rooms, we can always accommodate more guests.\n- Option D (moving everyone to the next room) would work in theory, but it's unnecessary and would inconvenience all guests.\n\nThe most straightforward and practical solution is to simply put the new guest in an empty room.
