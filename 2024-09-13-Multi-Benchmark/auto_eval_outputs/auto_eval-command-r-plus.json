Number the bottles from 0 to 999. \n2. Divide the bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each. \n3. Assign each group of bottles to one prisoner. \n4. On the first day, have each prisoner taste one bottle from their group, with each bottle in the group being tasted by only one prisoner. \n5. After 24 hours, identify the prisoner(s) who shows signs of poisoning. If there is one prisoner, you've found the poisoned bottle. If there are multiple affected prisoners, continue to the next step. \n6. Divide the bottles corresponding to the affected prisoners into subgroups and repeat the process. For example, if there are three affected prisoners, divide the bottles they tasted into subgroups of 10 and assign each subgroup to one of these prisoners. \n7. Continue this process for a maximum of 10 iterations (as there are 10 prisoners), and you will identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours. \n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time, without endangering the lives of the prisoners unnecessarily. It also leverages the concept of binary numbers, as each iteration effectively halves the number of possibilities, similar to how binary search identifies a specific element in a sorted array.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"17":{"level_0":17,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

Using a binary search strategy is the most efficient way to narrow down the possibilities and identify the poisoned bottle within the given time frame.\n\nHere's how the king can use a binary search strategy with 10 prisoners to find the poisoned bottle:\n\n1. **Divide the bottles into groups of 10:** Each prisoner is assigned 10 bottles, and they will taste-test the wine from each bottle.\n\n2. **Initial Testing (First 12 hours):** The prisoners will taste-test the wine from their assigned bottles, taking small sips to avoid consuming too much wine. This initial testing will help identify bottles that are obviously not poisoned (no bitter taste).\n\n3. **Narrow Down to 10 Bottles (Next 6 hours):** After the initial testing, the king can narrow down the search to 10 bottles (1 bottle from each prisoner's group) that require further investigation. These are bottles where the wine tasted bitter or unusual.\n\n4. **Final Testing and Identification (Last 6 hours):** With the remaining 10 bottles, the king can now perform a final round of testing. He can assign each of the 10 prisoners one of these bottles and have them consume a larger amount of wine (but not enough to be fatal). If a prisoner becomes ill or shows signs of poisoning within the next few hours, the king has identified the poisoned bottle.\n\nBy using a binary search strategy, the king only needs to perform two rounds of testing to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours.

Here's how it can be done:\n\n1. **Divide the bottles into 10 groups of 100 each**: Each prisoner is assigned a group of 100 bottles.\n2. **Test with a binary approach**: For each group, the assigned prisoner takes a sip from each bottle, starting with bottle number 1, then bottle number 2, up to bottle number 100. This is a binary approach, as each sip either confirms or denies the presence of poison, narrowing down the possibilities with each sip.\n3. **Narrow down the possibilities**: After the first sip, if no adverse reaction occurs, the prisoner moves on to the next bottle. If a bitter taste or adverse reaction occurs, the prisoner stops and notes the bottle number. This process continues for the next 9 bottles, effectively testing 10 bottles per prisoner in a systematic manner.\n4. **Identify the poisoned bottle**: Since the prisoners are testing the bottles in a binary manner, the king will know the exact bottle number that is poisoned within the 24-hour timeframe. This is because the binary search strategy reduces the search space by half with each test, making it possible to test all 1,000 bottles in just 10 tests.\n\nThis approach ensures the efficient utilization of the prisoners, the 24-hour timeframe, and the king's resources, making it the fastest way to identify the poisoned bottle of wine.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"77":{"level_0":77,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

This is a divide-and-conquer approach that minimizes the number of tests required. Here's how it can be done:\n\n- Assign each bottle a unique binary number from 0 to 1023 using 10 bits (as 10 prisoners are available). For example, Bottle 1 can be assigned 0000000001, Bottle 2: 0000000010, and so on.\n- Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups, each containing 100 bottles, corresponding to the 10 prisoners.\n- On the first day, each prisoner tests one group of 100 bottles by tasting only one sip from each bottle.\n- After 24 hours, the prisoners who tasted the poisoned wine will show symptoms or die.\n- Identify the binary number of the bottle(s) responsible for each prisoner's death. This can be done by looking at the bottles they tasted and finding the common wine bottle they all consumed.\n- The king now knows which bottle is poisoned without having to wait another 24 hours.\n\nThis strategy ensures the king can identify the poisoned bottle in the shortest time frame, within the 24-hour deadline, without endangering all the prisoners.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"107":{"level_0":107,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

This is far more efficient than Options A and B, which would require tasting all 1,000 bottles, and Option D, which would still likely require testing a large number of bottles depending on how many prisoners perish.\n\nHere's how the binary search can be done:\n\n1.

Assign each group a binary number from 0 to 1023, where the presence of a '1' indicates that the corresponding bottle is included in that group. For example, Group 1 could represent the number 73, which is 01001001 in binary, so it would contain bottles 0, 3, 6, and 7.\n4. Give each prisoner a group of bottles to test, corresponding to one of the binary numbers.\n5.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n\nThe fastest and most efficient way to identify the poisoned bottle is to use a binary search strategy. This method only requires a maximum of 10 tests (using the 10 prisoners) to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours. \n\nHere's how it works: \n\n1. **Encode Bottles**: Assign a unique binary code to each bottle, using 10 bits (for the 10 prisoners). For example, Bottle 1 could be coded as \"0000000001\", Bottle 2 as \"0000000010\", and so on. \n\n2. **Test Strategy**: \n   - **Test 1**: Give the prisoners wine based on the first bit of the code. For the first test, all 10 prisoners would drink wines with a '1' in the first position (Bottles 9-1000). \n   - **Test 2**: Depending on the results of Test 1, give wines based on the second bit. If the poisoned wine is in Bottles 1-512, Test 2 would use wines with a '1' in the second position (Bottles 3-64, etc.). \n   - This process continues, narrowing down the possibilities with each test. \n\n3. **Results in 24 Hours**: After each test, the king can eliminate a large number of bottles from consideration. With 10 tests, he can test all 1000 bottles. After the final test, he will know the exact bottle that is poisoned. \n\nThis strategy ensures that the king identifies the poisoned bottle in the shortest time frame, without endangering the lives of the prisoners any more than necessary.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"197":{"level_0":197,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"```json\n{\n    \"ANSWER\": \"B\"\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation**: The man is walking in a square pattern, ascending in elevation with each side of the square he walks. Each side he walks is 1 kilometer in length, and since he walks four sides, he has walked a total of 4 kilometers. Thus, he is 4 kilometers away from his starting point. \n\nFor the elevation, he starts at 0 meters and gains 300 meters, then 200 more, and finally another 200 meters on the last side, for a total of 700 meters of elevation gain. Therefore, his final elevation is 700 meters, or 700 meters above his starting point. \n\nSo, the man ends up 4 kilometers away from his starting point and at an elevation of 700 meters, which places him at a diagonal position from his starting point. Using the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides of 4km and 0.7km gives us the distance between the man and his starting point: \n\n\\begin{align*}\nc^2 &= a^2 + b^2 \\\\\nc &= \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\\\\nc &= \\sqrt{(4\\text{ km})^2 + (0.7\\text{ km})^2} \\\\\nc &\\approx \\sqrt{16\\text{ km}^2 + 0.49\\text{ km}^2} \\\\\nc &\\approx \\sqrt{16.49\\text{ km}^2} \\\\\nc &\\approx 4.06\\text{ km}\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo, the distance between the man and his starting point is approximately 4.06 kilometers. Since this is the closest he can get to his starting point (0 meters) at the given elevation of 700 meters, the final answer is approximately **2000 meters** away from the starting point.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"253":{"level_0":253,"index":14,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A group of four people needs to cross a bridge at night.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n\nThe fastest way to identify the poisoned bottle is to use a binary search strategy. This approach leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it can be done:\n\nAllocate a unique number to each of the 10 prisoners, from 0 to 9. These numbers represent the binary digits (bits) that can be combined to represent all the bottles of wine. Each bit represents a potential group of bottles that a prisoner will test.\n\nStart with the first bit (bit 0) and have prisoner 0 taste 500 bottles (from bottle 0 to 499). If the wine is poisoned and the prisoner dies within 24 hours, you know the poisoned wine is within those 500 bottles. If the prisoner survives, you know the poison is not in those bottles.\n\nMove to the next bit (bit 1) and allocate those bottles to prisoner 1. If the first prisoner survived, prisoner 1 tastes the second group of 250 bottles (from bottle 500 to 749). If the first prisoner died, prisoner 1 tastes the first group of 250 bottles (from bottle 0 to 249). This way, you are narrowing down the range of possible bottles.\n\nContinue this process, adjusting the range of bottles tested based on the survival or death of the previous prisoner. With each step, you are effectively dividing the remaining bottles in half.\n\nAfter 10 steps (using all 10 prisoners), you will have tested all 1000 bottles. The binary representation of the bottles will indicate which one is poisoned. For example, if prisoners 3, 5, and 10 die, the binary representation 0110010011 points to bottle number 467 as the poisoned one.\n\nThis binary search strategy ensures that you only need to test each bottle once and can identify the poisoned wine within 24 hours.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"257":{"level_0":257,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

The 'birthday problem' calculates the probability that, in a set of randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday. \n\nThe formula to calculate the probability (P) of people having the same birthday in a group of size n is:\n\nP = 1 - (L \/ L) * (L-1 \/ L-1) * ... * (L-n+1 \/ L-n+1)\n\nWhere:\n- L is the number of days in a year, assuming a leap year with 366 days.\n\nTo find the number of pairs of twins required for a 50% probability, we can use the formula and work backwards:\n\nP(50%) = 1 - (366 \/ 366) * (365 \/ 366) * ... = 0.5\n\nSolving for n (the number of people), we find that n = 23.

Since we started the timer when the first two people started crossing, we need to subtract the time it took for the first two to cross the bridge and add it to the total time: 2 minutes (for the first crossing) + 11 minutes (time left until the last person crosses) = **13 minutes**.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C, 13 minutes.","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"284":{"level_0":284,"index":15,"category":"Puzzle","question":"You're in a room with two doors that lead out.

This approach minimizes the number of tests required to identify the poisoned bottle. Here's how it can be done:\n\n1. Divide the 1,000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each, assigning each group to a prisoner.\n2. Each prisoner opens and tastes the first bottle from their group of 100.\n3. After 24 hours, the king identifies the prisoner(s) who tasted the poisoned wine (if any adverse effects are observed).\n4.

Continue this binary search process, dividing the groups by powers of 10 (10, 100, 1,000) until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy ensures that with each 24-hour cycle, the king can eliminate a significant number of bottles and narrow down the possibilities, ultimately leading to the identification of the poisoned bottle within the 24-hour timeframe.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"287":{"level_0":287,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

Now, to accommodate one more guest, we can ask that first guest to move to the next room, i.e., room 2. This frees up room 1 for the new guest. By doing so, we effectively create space for one more guest without needing to put guests in empty rooms or perform complex room number calculations. This strategy ensures that existing guests are still accommodated and that the new guest has a room.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"295":{"level_0":295,"index":26,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A runaway trolley is heading down the tracks away from five people upwards of the track.
