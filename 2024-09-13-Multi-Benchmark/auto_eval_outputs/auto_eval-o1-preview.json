Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"To identify the poisoned bottle among 1000 bottles using 10 prisoners within 24 hours, the most efficient method is to use binary representation. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Assign Binary Codes**: Number the bottles from 1 to 1000 and represent each number in binary form using 10 bits (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which covers all 1000 bottles).\n\n2. **Assign Prisoners to Bits**: Each prisoner is assigned to one of the 10 bit positions. For example, Prisoner 1 corresponds to the most significant bit (bit 10), and Prisoner 10 corresponds to the least significant bit (bit 1).\n\n3. **Administer Wine Samples**: For each bottle, if there is a '1' in a specific bit position of its binary code, the corresponding prisoner will taste the wine from that bottle. This means each prisoner will taste multiple wines, depending on the distribution of '1's in their assigned bit position across all bottles.\n\n4. **Observe the Results**: After 24 hours, some prisoners will die (those who drank from the poisoned bottle) and others will survive. The pattern of who dies and who survives forms a binary number where '1' represents a deceased prisoner and '0' represents a surviving prisoner.\n\n5. **Determine the Poisoned Bottle**: The resulting binary number directly corresponds to the binary code of the poisoned bottle. Converting this binary number back to decimal reveals the exact bottle number that is poisoned.\n\nThis method efficiently narrows down the poisoned bottle in a single round of testing within the 24-hour constraint by leveraging the concept of binary numbers.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"47":{"level_0":47,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

The fact that no bullet came out means the gun fired the empty chamber.\n- Revolvers typically advance to the next chamber after each trigger pull.\n- This means that if you do not spin again, the next chamber in line is one of the five loaded ones.\n- **Therefore, if you do not spin, there is a 100% chance that the next chamber contains a bullet**, leading to an unfortunate outcome.\n\n**With Spinning Again:**\n\n- By spinning the chambers, you randomize the position of the cylinder.\n- Each chamber has an equal probability of aligning with the firing mechanism.\n- There is one empty chamber out of six.\n- **Therefore, by spinning again, you have a 1 in 6 chance (approximately 16.67%) of aligning the empty chamber and surviving.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSpinning the chambers again gives you a better chance of survival (approximately 16.67%) compared to not spinning (0% chance).

When you pick Door No.1, the probability that it has the gold bar is 1\/3. The remaining two doors (Door No.2 and Door No.3) collectively have a 2\/3 chance of hiding the gold bar.\n\nIn this scenario, the host offers you the option to switch your choice to Door No.2. However, unlike the classic Monty Hall problem, the host doesn't provide any additional information (such as revealing a door with a rotten vegetable). Without any new information or action from the host that changes the probabilities, each door still holds an independent 1\/3 chance of concealing the gold bar.\n\nThe host's offer to switch to Door No.2 does not influence the probabilities because he hasn't revealed any doors or provided hints about what's behind them. Therefore, switching to Door No.2 doesn't give you any advantage over staying with Door No.1, and neither does choosing Door No.3.

However, since the poison is described as \"very bitter,\" there's a faster method.\n  \n- **Option C:** Dividing the bottles and waiting to see who dies after 24 hours is time-consuming and risks prisoner lives when it's not necessary.\n  \n- **Option D:** Since the poison is *very bitter*, the prisoners can detect the poisoned bottle immediately by taste. By dividing the bottles among the prisoners and having them taste for bitterness, the king can identify the poisoned bottle without waiting 24 hours.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is to have the prisoners taste the wine and detect the bitterness immediately.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"107":{"level_0":107,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

Your opponent spins the chambers, fires at himself, and survives. This means the empty chamber was just fired.\n\nIf you choose **not** to spin again, the revolver's cylinder remains in the same position it was after your opponent's turn. In most revolvers, pulling the trigger advances the cylinder to the next chamber. Since the empty chamber has just been used, the next chamber must be one of the five loaded ones. This means you have a 100% chance of firing a bullet if you don't spin again.\n\nBy choosing to spin the chambers again, you reset the cylinder's position, giving you a 1 in 6 chance (approximately 16.7%) of landing on the empty chamber and surviving.

After you pick Door No.1, the host offers you the option to switch to Door No.2. This situation is a variation of the classic Monty Hall problem.\n\nIn the traditional Monty Hall problem, the host, who knows what is behind each door, always opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat (or, in this case, rotten vegetables) and then offers you the chance to switch to the remaining unopened door. The key factor is that the host's actions provide additional information because they never reveal the prize behind the doors they open.\n\nIn this variation, the host is giving you a specific option to switch to Door No.2 without revealing what is behind any other door. If we assume that the host is acting strategically and knows where the gold bar is, offering you Door No.2 could be a hint that the gold bar is behind that door. There is no reason for the host to favor Door No.2 unless it increases the excitement of the game or the chances of you winning.\n\nAlternatively, if the host always offers the option to switch to Door No.2 regardless of your initial choice, then there is no advantage in switching, as all doors would have an equal probability.\n\nHowever, given that the host specifically offers Door No.2 and not Door No.3, and assuming the host knows the location of the prize and is intentionally providing you an opportunity, switching to Door No.2 gives you the biggest advantage.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"152":{"level_0":152,"index":3,"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This means that while on the boat, any combination of the wolf, goat, and cabbage can be safely transported together because the compartments prevent them from interacting.\n   - The boat can accommodate all three items **simultaneously**, along with the farmer.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n- Since the boat can carry all three items at once in secure compartments, the farmer can load the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage into the boat and transport them to the other side of the river in **one crossing**.\n- There are no issues on either shore during this operation:\n  - **Starting Shore:** The farmer is present, so no eating occurs before departure.\n  - **Boat Crossing:** The secure compartments prevent any animal from eating another.\n  - **Destination Shore:** Upon arrival, the farmer is still present with all the items, so no eating occurs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe minimum number of crossings required is **one**, as the farmer can safely transport all three items together in a single trip using the boat's secure compartments.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"154":{"level_0":154,"index":5,"category":"Puzzle","question":"Bob has three boxes in front of him - Box A, Box B and Box C.

Only one chamber is empty.\n- **After Opponent's Turn**: Your opponent spins the cylinder and fires at himself. He survives, which means the hammer fell on the one empty chamber.\n- **Revolver Mechanics**: In most revolvers, pulling the trigger rotates the cylinder to the next chamber before the hammer strikes.

Notice that these gains don't follow a simple arithmetic progression, but if we look at them cumulatively, the total elevation after three legs is **900m**.\n\n4. **Fourth Leg**: He turns left again (now facing north) and walks **1 km north**, returning to his starting horizontal position. To find his final elevation, we can deduce the elevation gain based on the pattern of previous gains. \n\nLet's consider that the elevation gains could be doubling every other leg:\n\n- **First Leg**: 300m\n- **Second Leg**: 200m\n- **Third Leg**: 400m (which is double the second leg's gain)\n- **Fourth Leg**: Assuming the pattern continues, the gain would double from the second leg to the fourth leg, so **200m x 2 = 400m**. However, since the third leg already had a gain of 400m, perhaps the fourth leg's gain doubles from the third leg: **400m x 2 = 800m**.\n\nAdding this to the previous total elevation:\n\n- **Total Elevation Gain**: 300m + 200m + 400m + **800m** = **1700m**\n\nSo, his final elevation after the fourth leg is **1700m**. Horizontally, since he walked in a square (1 km per side and turned left each time), he ends up exactly where he started, so he is **0 meters from his starting point**.\n\n**Answer D** states that he is **0m from starting point, 1700m elevation**, which matches our conclusion.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"283":{"level_0":283,"index":14,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A group of four people needs to cross a bridge at night.

The key is to minimize the number of tests while maximizing the information each test provides.\n\nHere's the optimal strategy:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Label each of the 1000 bottles with a unique number from 1 to 1000. Then, convert these numbers into 10-bit binary numbers (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) covers all 1000 bottles).\n\n2. **Assigning Tests to Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners is assigned to a bit position in these binary numbers. \n   - Prisoner 1 checks the bottles where the least significant bit (rightmost) is 1.\n   - Prisoner 2 checks the bottles where the second bit from the right is 1.\n   - This pattern continues up to Prisoner 10, who checks the bottles where the most significant bit (leftmost) is 1.\n\n3. **Testing the Wine**: For each bottle, if a bit in its binary representation is 1, the corresponding prisoner drinks a sample from that bottle. Since each bottle corresponds to a unique combination of bits\/prisoners, the poisoned bottle will uniquely affect a combination of prisoners.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Results**: After 24 hours, some prisoners will have died (those who drank from the poisoned bottle), and some will be alive. By recording which prisoners died (representing bits with value 1) and which survived (bits with value 0), the king can reconstruct the binary number corresponding to the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can precisely identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours using only 10 prisoners. It leverages the properties of binary numbers to maximize efficiency and minimize the number of required tests.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is:**\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"287":{"level_0":287,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

The paradox states that in a group of 23 people, there's about a 50% chance that at least two people share the same birthday. This counterintuitive result arises because we're considering all possible pairs of people and the probabilities compound quickly as the group size increases.\n\nIn the context of the question, we're dealing with **pairs of twins**. Each twin pair shares the same birthday by definition. Therefore, when considering the birthdays, each twin pair can be thought of as a single entity with a unique birthday. So, if we have \\( N \\) pairs of twins, we effectively have \\( N \\) unique birthdays (assuming no overlap between pairs).\n\nThe problem then reduces to finding the number of twin pairs needed so that there's at least a 50% chance that **two different pairs of twins** share the same birthday. This is analogous to the classic birthday problem but with \\( N \\) individuals instead of \\( 2N \\).\n\nUsing the birthday paradox threshold of 23 individuals, we find that:\n\n- **Option A**: 23 pairs (which is 46 people but effectively 23 unique birthdays)\n- **Option B**: 12 pairs (24 people, 12 unique birthdays)\n\nSince we need at least 23 unique birthdays to have a 50% chance that two birthdays coincide among the pairs, the correct answer is **Option A: 23 pairs**.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"294":{"level_0":294,"index":25,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
