Given the constraints:\n\n1. One guardian always tells the truth and guards the death door.\n2. The other guardian always lies and guards the freedom door.\n\nYou can ask a single question to either guardian to determine the correct door. The key is to frame the question in such a way that it accounts for both the truth-teller and the liar.\n\nHere's the question you can ask either guardian:\n\"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would they point to?\"\n\n- If you ask the truth-teller, they will truthfully tell you that the liar would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the liar, they will lie about the truth-teller's response and also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the door they point to will be the death door. Therefore, you should choose the opposite door to ensure your safety.\n\nThus, the minimum number of questions needed is one.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"To solve this problem efficiently, we need to minimize the number of tests required to identify the poisoned bottle using the 10 prisoners available. The key insight here is to use a binary representation to test the bottles.\n\nEach of the 1000 bottles can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is more than 1000). We can assign each bottle a binary number from 0000000000 to 1111100111 (for bottles 1 to 1000).\n\nEach prisoner will be assigned to a specific bit position in these binary numbers. For example:\n- Prisoner 1 will be responsible for the least significant bit (2^0).\n- Prisoner 2 will be responsible for the next bit (2^1).\n- And so on, up to Prisoner 10 who will be responsible for the most significant bit (2^9).\n\nEach prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1. For instance:\n- Prisoner 1 will drink from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. (all odd-numbered bottles).\n- Prisoner 2 will drink from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, etc. (bottles where the second bit is 1).\n\nAfter 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number that directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle's binary representation. This method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing.\n\nGiven this strategy, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
