Only one chamber is empty.\n- **After Opponent's Turn**: Your opponent spins the cylinder and fires at himself. He survives, which means the hammer fell on the one empty chamber.\n- **Revolver Mechanics**: In most revolvers, pulling the trigger rotates the cylinder to the next chamber before the hammer strikes. This means that after your opponent's turn, the next chamber is one position ahead.\n\n**If You Do Not Spin Again**:\n- The cylinder is currently positioned such that the last chamber fired was empty.\n- The next chamber (which will be aligned when you pull the trigger) must be one of the five loaded chambers since there's only one empty chamber and it was just used.\n- **Probability of Survival**: 0%. You're certain to fire a bullet if you don't spin.\n\n**If You Spin Again**:\n- Spinning randomizes the position of the cylinder.\n- The probability that the chamber aligns with the empty one is **1 out of 6**, or approximately **16.67%**.\n- **Probability of Survival**: 16.67%.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- Spinning the cylinder gives you a chance of survival, whereas not spinning leads to certain death.\n- Therefore, **you should spin again** to maximize your chances of survival.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.
