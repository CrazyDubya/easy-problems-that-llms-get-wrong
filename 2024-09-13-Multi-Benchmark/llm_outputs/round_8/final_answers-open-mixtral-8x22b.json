Wait 24 hours to see which prisoners die.\n4. If none of the prisoners die, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was not tested.\n5. If one prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that the prisoner drank from.\n6. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles and prisoners until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle with the fewest number of tests possible, which is important given the time constraint of 24 hours. Option A is not ideal because it would require the king to wait for a prisoner to die before identifying the poisoned bottle, which could take longer than 24 hours. Option C is not reliable because the poison may not have a noticeable taste. Option D is not ethical and would require all prisoners to drink from all bottles, which is not necessary to identify the poisoned bottle.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
