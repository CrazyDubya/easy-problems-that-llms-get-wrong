Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nD. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\n\nProvide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the binary search strategy (option B) is the most efficient solution:\n\n* **The Problem:** Identify one poisoned bottle out of 1000 within 24 hours.\n* **Why Binary Search Works:**  Binary search is about repeatedly dividing the search space in half.  Here's how it applies:\n\n    1. **Numbering:** Imagine each bottle is numbered from 0 to 999.\n    2. **Day 1:**\n       * Convert each bottle's number to its binary representation (e.g., bottle 7 is 000000111).\n       * Each prisoner represents a specific digit position in the binary numbers (e.g., prisoner 1 represents the 1's place, prisoner 2 represents the 2's place, etc.).\n       * Each prisoner drinks from bottles where their corresponding binary digit is a '1'. For example, from bottle 7, prisoners 1, 2, and 3 would drink.\n    3. **Day 2:**\n       * Observe which prisoners died. If prisoner 1 dies, it means the poisoned bottle's binary representation has a '1' in the 1's place. If prisoner 3 dies, the poisoned bottle has a '1' in the 8's place, and so on.\n       * Construct the binary number of the poisoned bottle based on which prisoners died. Convert this binary number back to decimal to find the poisoned bottle.\n\n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n    * **A & D:**  This is a brute-force method and highly unethical. It also doesn't guarantee finding the bottle in 24 hours if multiple prisoners die.\n    * **C:** The poison takes 24 hours to take effect, so tasting it won't help identify the poisoned bottle in time. \n\n* **Efficiency:** Binary search allows you to test up to 1024 (2^10) bottles with 10 prisoners. This method guarantees you'll find the poisoned bottle within the 24-hour time limit.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
