In each race, you can eliminate the slower horses and advance the faster ones to the next round. \n\nA single-elimination tournament with six horses would proceed as follows:\n1.

The winners of the first round compete, and the two fastest horses advance to the final.\n3. Final: The last race is between the two remaining horses to determine the fastest.\n\nTherefore, a minimum of **three races** is needed to determine the fastest horse out of six.","score":""},"2":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a gold bar; behind the others, rotten vegetables.

Filling the 2-gallon jug twice (*Answer A*) would give us 4 gallons, but we'd need to consider the practical aspect of pouring and ensuring the exact measurements, which might not be efficient. \n\n*Answer B* and *Answer C* are not efficient methods either, as they involve using jugs with capacities greater than the target amount, which would require careful pouring and might result in spills or inaccurate measurements. \n\nThe most efficient method is to:\n1.
