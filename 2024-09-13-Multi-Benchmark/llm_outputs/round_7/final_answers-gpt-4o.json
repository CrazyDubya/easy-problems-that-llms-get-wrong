The other guardian always lies and guards the freedom door.\n\nYou can ask a single question to either guardian to determine the correct door. The key is to frame the question in such a way that it accounts for both the truth-teller and the liar.\n\nHere's the question you can ask either guardian:\n\"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would they point to?\"\n\n- If you ask the truth-teller, they will truthfully tell you that the liar would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the liar, they will lie about the truth-teller's response and also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the door they point to will be the death door.

The key insight here is to use a binary representation to maximize the information we can gather from each prisoner.\n\nEach prisoner can be thought of as a binary digit (bit) in a 10-bit binary number. With 10 prisoners, we can represent up to \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) different states, which is more than enough to cover the 1000 bottles of wine.\n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Number each bottle of wine from 1 to 1000.\n2. Convert each bottle number to its 10-bit binary equivalent.\n3. Assign each prisoner to a specific bit position (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit).\n4. Have each prisoner drink from all the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1 in the binary representation of the bottle number.\n5. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners are dead. The combination of dead and alive prisoners will form a binary number.\n6.
