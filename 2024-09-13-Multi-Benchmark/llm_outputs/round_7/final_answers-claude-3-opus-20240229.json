This allows testing all 1000 bottles with just 10 prisoners.\n\nFor example:\nBottle 1 is represented as 0000000001 in binary. So prisoner 10 drinks from this bottle.  \nBottle 2 is 0000000010 in binary. So prisoner 9 drinks from this bottle.\nBottle 3 is 0000000011 in binary. So prisoners 9 and 10 both drink from this bottle.\nAnd so on for all 1000 bottles.\n\nAfter 24 hours, based on which prisoners have died, the king can determine the exact number of the poisoned bottle from the 'binary' number represented by the dead prisoners. \n\nThis strategy only requires 1 round of testing and will conclusively identify the poisoned bottle number in 24 hours, so it is the most optimal approach.\",\n\n  \"ANSWER\": \"B\"\n}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
