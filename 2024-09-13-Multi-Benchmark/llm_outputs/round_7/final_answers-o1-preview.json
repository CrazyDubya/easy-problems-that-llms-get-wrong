He fired and survived, which means he must have landed on the empty chamber. In most revolvers, the cylinder advances to the next chamber when the trigger is pulled. This means that the next chamber is likely to contain a bullet.\n\nIf you do not spin again, you are almost certain to face a bullet because the gun is now aligned with the next loaded chamber. However, if you spin the chambers again, you randomize the position of the empty chamber, giving yourself a 1 in 6 chance of survival (since there is one empty chamber out of six).\n\nTherefore, spinning again increases your chances of survival from nearly zero to approximately 16.7%.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Since the poisoned wine is described as **very bitter**, the key insight is that the poison alters the taste of the wine, making it detectable upon sampling.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n- **Detecting by Taste**: Because the poisoned bottle tastes very bitter, any prisoner who tastes it will immediately know it's the poisoned one.\n- **Fastest Method**: Having the prisoners taste the wine and note any bitterness allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle immediately, without waiting for the poison to take effect.\n- **Division of Labor**: By dividing the 1000 bottles among the 10 prisoners, each prisoner samples a portion of the bottles, ensuring that all bottles are tasted in the shortest time possible.\n\nTherefore, the fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is to have the prisoners taste the wines and report any that taste bitter.\n\n**Answer C**, while efficient in scenarios where the poison is undetectable by taste (using binary encoding to minimize the number of tests), is unnecessary here because the bitterness provides an immediate indicator.\n\n**Answer D** aligns perfectly with this reasoning.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
