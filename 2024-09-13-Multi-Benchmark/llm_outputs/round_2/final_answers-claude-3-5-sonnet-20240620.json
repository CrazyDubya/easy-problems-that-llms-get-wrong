When the host asks if you want to switch to Door No. 2, it's important to note that the host knows where the gold bar is and is intentionally not offering you the option to switch to Door No. 3.\n\n4. This implies that if the gold bar was behind Door No. 3, the host wouldn't be offering you Door No. 2.\n\n5.

We know that one guardian always tells the truth and the other always lies.\n2. We also know that the truthful guardian is guarding the death door.\n3. We need to find a way to identify the door to freedom with minimal questions.\n\nThe key is to ask a question that will give us the correct information regardless of which guardian we ask. Here's a question that would work:\n\n\"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\nLet's analyze the responses:\n\n- If we ask the truthful guardian: They would truthfully tell us what the lying guardian would say, which would be the wrong door (death door).\n- If we ask the lying guardian: They would lie about what the truthful guardian would say, which would also result in indicating the wrong door (death door).\n\nIn both cases, the answer we receive will point to the death door. Therefore, we know that the opposite door is the one leading to freedom.\n\nThis clever question allows us to determine the correct door with just one question, regardless of which guardian we ask.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of questions needed is one.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.
