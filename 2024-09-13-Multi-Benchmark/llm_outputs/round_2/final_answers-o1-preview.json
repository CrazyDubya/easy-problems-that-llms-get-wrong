Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"To identify the poisoned bottle among 1000 bottles using 10 prisoners within 24 hours, the most efficient method is to use binary representation. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Assign Binary Codes**: Number the bottles from 1 to 1000 and represent each number in binary form using 10 bits (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which covers all 1000 bottles).\n\n2. **Assign Prisoners to Bits**: Each prisoner is assigned to one of the 10 bit positions. For example, Prisoner 1 corresponds to the most significant bit (bit 10), and Prisoner 10 corresponds to the least significant bit (bit 1).\n\n3. **Administer Wine Samples**: For each bottle, if there is a '1' in a specific bit position of its binary code, the corresponding prisoner will taste the wine from that bottle. This means each prisoner will taste multiple wines, depending on the distribution of '1's in their assigned bit position across all bottles.\n\n4. **Observe the Results**: After 24 hours, some prisoners will die (those who drank from the poisoned bottle) and others will survive. The pattern of who dies and who survives forms a binary number where '1' represents a deceased prisoner and '0' represents a surviving prisoner.\n\n5. **Determine the Poisoned Bottle**: The resulting binary number directly corresponds to the binary code of the poisoned bottle. Converting this binary number back to decimal reveals the exact bottle number that is poisoned.\n\nThis method efficiently narrows down the poisoned bottle in a single round of testing within the 24-hour constraint by leveraging the concept of binary numbers.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
