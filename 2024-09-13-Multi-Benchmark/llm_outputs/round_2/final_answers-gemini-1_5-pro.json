Door No. 2**:\n\n**Understanding the Monty Hall Problem**\n\nThis is a classic probability puzzle known as the Monty Hall Problem. It's counterintuitive, but switching doors significantly increases your chances of winning. Here's why:\n\n1. **Initial Choice:** When you initially chose Door No. 1, you had a 1\/3 chance of selecting the door with the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance of selecting a door with rotten vegetables.\n\n2. **Host's Action:** The host *always* reveals rotten vegetables behind one of the doors you didn't pick. This action doesn't change the initial odds that your first choice was wrong (which was 2\/3).  Crucially, the host's knowledge of where the prize is allows them to concentrate the probability.\n\n3. **The Switch:** When you switch to Door No. 2, you're essentially taking advantage of the combined 2\/3 probability that the gold bar was initially behind either Door No. 2 or Door No. 3. The host's reveal has concentrated that entire 2\/3 probability onto the single door you didn't initially choose.\n\n**In Conclusion**\n\nSwitching doors from your original choice to the remaining closed door doubles your chances of winning the gold bar.\n\n**JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n``` \n","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\nANSWERS\nA. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nD. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\n\nProvide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the correct answer is **B** and the reasoning behind it:\n\n* **A is incorrect** because it would likely kill all the prisoners. You can't guarantee an even distribution of a single poisoned bottle.\n* **C is incorrect** because the poison is stated to be tasteless (only taking effect after 24 hours).\n* **D is incorrect** because it's incredibly inefficient and doesn't leverage the information gained from each test.\n\n**B is correct: The Binary Search Strategy**\n\n1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10. Convert each prisoner's number into its binary equivalent (e.g., Prisoner 1 is 001, Prisoner 2 is 010, Prisoner 3 is 011, etc.).  Think of each prisoner representing a 'bit' in a binary number.\n2. **Wine Sampling:** Each bottle of wine is also assigned a number from 1 to 1000.  A prisoner will take a tiny sip from a bottle if their corresponding 'bit' position in the bottle's binary number is a '1'.  \n   * For example, Bottle 5 (binary 101) would be sipped by Prisoner 1 and Prisoner 3.\n3. **Observation:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died. Construct a binary number where '1' represents a dead prisoner and '0' represents a living prisoner. This binary number directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle number.\n\n**Example:**\n\nIf Prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 011001, which translates to decimal number 25, indicating bottle number 25 was poisoned.\n\n**Why Binary Search is Efficient:**  Binary search allows you to test a large sample space very quickly. With each test, you eliminate half of the remaining possibilities. In this case, 10 prisoners can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
