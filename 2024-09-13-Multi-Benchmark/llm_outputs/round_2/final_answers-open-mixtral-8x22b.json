In the first round, we can divide the horses into three pairs and race them, which will require three races. The winners of these races will then move on to the second round.\n\nIn the second round, we race the three winners from the first round. This will require one more race.

Initially, you have a 1\/3 chance of choosing the door with the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance of choosing a door with rotten vegetables.\n2. When the host shows you one of the other doors with rotten vegetables, it doesn't change the probability that you initially chose the correct door.

Since the host always reveals a door with rotten vegetables, the probability that the gold bar is behind one of the other two doors increases to 2\/3.\n4. Since the host can't open the door you initially chose or the door with the gold bar, the only door he can open is the one with rotten vegetables.

What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\nANSWERS\nA. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC.

This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from one bottle in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoner, if any, dies.\n4. If a prisoner dies, the poisoned bottle is in their group. If no one dies, the poisoned bottle is in the remaining 900 bottles.\n5. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles, dividing them into 9 groups of 100 bottles each and assigning them to the remaining prisoners.\n6. Continue this process until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle with the fewest number of tests possible, minimizing the risk to the prisoners and ensuring that the poisoned bottle is identified in time for the event.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
