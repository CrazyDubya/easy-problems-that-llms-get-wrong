This means there is only one empty chamber. When your opponent spins the chambers and fires at himself, he lands on the empty chamber, so there are now five chambers left, all of which contain bullets.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, you will be firing from one of the remaining five chambers, all of which are loaded with bullets.

The other guardian always lies and guards the freedom door.\n\nYou can ask a single question to either guardian to determine the correct door. The key is to frame the question in such a way that it accounts for both the truth-teller and the liar.\n\nThe question you can ask is: \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would they point to?\"\n\n- If you ask the truth-teller, they will truthfully tell you that the liar would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the liar, they will lie about the truth-teller's response and also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the door they point to will be the death door. Therefore, you should choose the opposite door to ensure your safety.\n\nThus, the minimum number of questions needed is one.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

Therefore, we need to use a method that allows us to observe the bulbs directly.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA.

However, the problem does not specify that you can observe the bulbs directly from the same room.\n\nB. You must walk into another room to observe the bulbs.\n- This option suggests that you cannot observe the bulbs directly from the same room, which aligns with the problem's implication that you need to walk into another room to see the bulbs.\n\nC.

The key insight here is to use a binary representation to maximize the information gained from each test.\n\nEach of the 1000 bottles can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000). We can assign each bottle a binary number from 0000000000 to 1111100111 (for bottles 1 to 1000).\n\nHere's the strategy:\n1. Assign each bottle a unique binary number.\n2. Each prisoner will represent a bit position in the binary number (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit).\n3. If a bit in the binary number is 1, the corresponding prisoner will drink from that bottle. If the bit is 0, the prisoner will not drink from that bottle.\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners are dead. The combination of dead and alive prisoners will form a binary number that corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, leveraging the binary representation to use the 10 prisoners efficiently.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
