When you pick Door No.1, the probability that it has the gold bar is 1\/3. The remaining two doors (Door No.2 and Door No.3) collectively have a 2\/3 chance of hiding the gold bar.\n\nIn this scenario, the host offers you the option to switch your choice to Door No.2. However, unlike the classic Monty Hall problem, the host doesn't provide any additional information (such as revealing a door with a rotten vegetable). Without any new information or action from the host that changes the probabilities, each door still holds an independent 1\/3 chance of concealing the gold bar.\n\nThe host's offer to switch to Door No.2 does not influence the probabilities because he hasn't revealed any doors or provided hints about what's behind them. Therefore, switching to Door No.2 doesn't give you any advantage over staying with Door No.1, and neither does choosing Door No.3. All doors have an equal probability of winning.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

However, since the poison is described as \"very bitter,\" there's a faster method.\n  \n- **Option C:** Dividing the bottles and waiting to see who dies after 24 hours is time-consuming and risks prisoner lives when it's not necessary.\n  \n- **Option D:** Since the poison is *very bitter*, the prisoners can detect the poisoned bottle immediately by taste. By dividing the bottles among the prisoners and having them taste for bitterness, the king can identify the poisoned bottle without waiting 24 hours.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is to have the prisoners taste the wine and detect the bitterness immediately.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
