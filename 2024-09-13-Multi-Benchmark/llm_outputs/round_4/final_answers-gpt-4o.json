The other guardian always lies and guards the freedom door.\n\nWe can use a logical approach to determine the correct door with just one question. The key is to ask a question that forces both guardians to give the same answer, regardless of their nature (truth-teller or liar).\n\nHere's the question you can ask either guardian:\n\"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\n- If you ask the truth-telling guardian, they will truthfully tell you that the lying guardian would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the lying guardian, they will lie about the truth-telling guardian's response, and also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the answer you get will point to the death door. Therefore, you should choose the opposite door to ensure your safety.\n\nThus, the minimum number of questions needed is one.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"To solve this problem efficiently, we need to leverage the 10 prisoners in a way that allows us to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours. The key is to use a binary representation strategy, which allows us to test all 1000 bottles with just 10 prisoners.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0 to 999 (which is 1000 in decimal). Each binary number will have a length of 10 bits (since 2^10 = 1024, which covers all 1000 bottles).\n\n2. **Assigning Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners will be assigned to a specific bit position in the binary representation of the bottle numbers. For example, Prisoner 1 will be responsible for the least significant bit (2^0), Prisoner 2 for the next bit (2^1), and so on up to Prisoner 10 for the most significant bit (2^9).\n\n3. **Testing the Wine**: Each prisoner will drink from the bottles where their corresponding bit is set to 1. For instance, if a bottle's binary representation is 1010101010, then Prisoners 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 will drink from that bottle.\n\n4. **Identifying the Poisoned Bottle**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the poisoned bottle's number.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing and within the 24-hour limit.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

You ask each current guest to move to the room number n*2.\n   - This would move each guest to an even-numbered room, effectively freeing up all the odd-numbered rooms.
