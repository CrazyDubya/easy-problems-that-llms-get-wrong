However, your question is about pairs of twins, which makes it a bit different.\n\nIn a room with pairs of twins, each pair shares the same birthday, so you only need one pair of twins to guarantee that two people have the same birthday. However, the question asks for at least a 50% chance, not a guarantee.\n\nSince each pair of twins is a single birthday (as they share the same birthday), we can treat this as a standard birthday paradox problem. In this case, we're looking for the number of birthdays (not people), which means we're looking for the number of pairs of twins.\n\nThe standard birthday paradox problem is solved using the formula 1 - (365! \/ (365^n * (365 - n)!)), where n is the number of people and 365 is the number of days in a year. We set this equal to 0.5 (50%) and solve for n. The answer is approximately 23 people.\n\nHowever, since we're dealing with pairs of twins, each pair counts as one birthday. So, we would need 23 pairs of twins to have a 50% chance that two pairs of twins share the same birthday.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
