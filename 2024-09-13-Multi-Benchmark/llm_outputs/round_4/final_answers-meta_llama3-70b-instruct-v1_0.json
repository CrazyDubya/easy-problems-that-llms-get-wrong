For two people, the probability that they don't share a birthday is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) = 364\/365, since the second person can't have the same birthday as the first person. For three people, the probability that they don't share a birthday is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) = 364\/365 \u00d7 363\/365.\n\nAs we add more people to the room, the probability that they don't share a birthday decreases. We want to find the smallest number of people (or pairs of twins) such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is greater than or equal to 50%.\n\nUsing the formula for the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday, we can calculate that with 23 pairs of twins (46 people), the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is approximately 50.7%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
