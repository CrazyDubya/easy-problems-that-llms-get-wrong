So pulling the lever has a direct positive impact on the lives of those five individuals by saving them from being killed by the runaway trolley.\n\nNot pulling the lever would result in the trolley continuing on the main track and killing the five people.

So there is a clear difference in outcomes based on the choice to pull the lever or not.\n\nThis is a classic ethical dilemma because it pits the principle of taking action to save a greater number of lives against the principle of not actively being the agent of someone's death (assuming there is one person on the side track who would be killed).
