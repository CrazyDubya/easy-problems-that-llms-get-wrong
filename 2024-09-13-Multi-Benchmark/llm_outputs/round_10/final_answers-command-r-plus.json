As these numbers are very close to 1, their logarithms are small, and we can approximate this sum by an integral:\nThe integral from 364 to 365-n of ln (x\/365) dx \u2248 ln (364\/365) + ln (363\/365) + ... + ln [(365-n+1)\/365)]\n\nIntegrating and evaluating the integral, we get:\n[-x\/365 - 1\/365 * ln (x\/365)] from 364 to 365-n = ln 0.5\n\nPlugging in the values:\n[-(365-n)\/365 - 1\/365 * ln ((365-n)\/365)] - [-364\/365 - 1\/365 * ln (364\/365)] = ln 0.5\n\nSimplifying:\n-n\/365 + 1\/365 * ln (365\/365-n) + 364\/365 + 1\/365 * ln (364\/365) = ln 0.5\n\nNow, we can solve for n:\n-n\/365 + 1\/365 * ln (1 - n\/365) = -ln 2\n\nMultiplying by -365:\nn + ln (1 - n\/365) = 365 * ln 2\n\nNow, we can use a root-finding method (such as Newton-Raphson) to solve for n. The value of n that satisfies this equation is approximately 23.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
