We don't know which door leads to freedom and which to death.\n\nThe key is to ask a question that will give us the correct information regardless of which guard we ask. Here's a question that accomplishes this:\n\n\"If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\nHere's why this works:\n- If you ask the truthful guard, they will truthfully tell you what the lying guard would say, which would be the wrong door (death).\n- If you ask the lying guard, they will lie about what the truthful guard would say, which again would be the wrong door (death).\n\nIn both cases, the answer you receive will point to the death door. Therefore, you should choose the opposite door to reach freedom.\n\nThis clever question allows us to determine the correct door with just one question, regardless of which guard we ask.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of questions needed is one.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.
