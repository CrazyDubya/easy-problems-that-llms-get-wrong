Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"To solve this problem efficiently, we need a method that allows the king to determine exactly which bottle is poisoned using the limited number of prisoners and within the 24-hour time frame. The key is to minimize the number of tests while maximizing the information each test provides.\n\nHere's the optimal strategy:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Label each of the 1000 bottles with a unique number from 1 to 1000. Then, convert these numbers into 10-bit binary numbers (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) covers all 1000 bottles).\n\n2. **Assigning Tests to Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners is assigned to a bit position in these binary numbers. \n   - Prisoner 1 checks the bottles where the least significant bit (rightmost) is 1.\n   - Prisoner 2 checks the bottles where the second bit from the right is 1.\n   - This pattern continues up to Prisoner 10, who checks the bottles where the most significant bit (leftmost) is 1.\n\n3. **Testing the Wine**: For each bottle, if a bit in its binary representation is 1, the corresponding prisoner drinks a sample from that bottle. Since each bottle corresponds to a unique combination of bits\/prisoners, the poisoned bottle will uniquely affect a combination of prisoners.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Results**: After 24 hours, some prisoners will have died (those who drank from the poisoned bottle), and some will be alive. By recording which prisoners died (representing bits with value 1) and which survived (bits with value 0), the king can reconstruct the binary number corresponding to the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can precisely identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours using only 10 prisoners. It leverages the properties of binary numbers to maximize efficiency and minimize the number of required tests.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is:**\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

The paradox states that in a group of 23 people, there's about a 50% chance that at least two people share the same birthday. This counterintuitive result arises because we're considering all possible pairs of people and the probabilities compound quickly as the group size increases.\n\nIn the context of the question, we're dealing with **pairs of twins**. Each twin pair shares the same birthday by definition. Therefore, when considering the birthdays, each twin pair can be thought of as a single entity with a unique birthday. So, if we have \\( N \\) pairs of twins, we effectively have \\( N \\) unique birthdays (assuming no overlap between pairs).\n\nThe problem then reduces to finding the number of twin pairs needed so that there's at least a 50% chance that **two different pairs of twins** share the same birthday. This is analogous to the classic birthday problem but with \\( N \\) individuals instead of \\( 2N \\).\n\nUsing the birthday paradox threshold of 23 individuals, we find that:\n\n- **Option A**: 23 pairs (which is 46 people but effectively 23 unique birthdays)\n- **Option B**: 12 pairs (24 people, 12 unique birthdays)\n\nSince we need at least 23 unique birthdays to have a 50% chance that two birthdays coincide among the pairs, the correct answer is **Option A: 23 pairs**.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
