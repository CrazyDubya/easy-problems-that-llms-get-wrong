Convert each prisoner's number to its binary equivalent (e.g., Prisoner 1 is 001, Prisoner 2 is 010, Prisoner 3 is 011, etc.).  Each digit in the binary number represents a specific wine bottle group.\n2. **Wine Assignment:** Each bottle of wine is also assigned a number from 1 to 1000.  \n3. **Sampling:**  Prisoner 1 will sip from every bottle whose corresponding binary number has a '1' in the rightmost digit. Prisoner 2 will sip from every bottle whose corresponding binary number has a '1' in the second digit from the right, and so on.\n4. **Observation:** After 24 hours, observe which prisoners have died. Construct a binary number where '1' represents a dead prisoner and '0' represents a living prisoner. This binary number, when converted to decimal, will be the number of the poisoned bottle.\n\n**Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 011001, which converts to 25, indicating bottle number 25 is poisoned.\n\n**Efficiency:** This method allows for testing up to 1024 (2^10) bottles with 10 prisoners, making it the most efficient solution.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"Here's the breakdown:\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nThis problem is a twist on the classic \"Birthday Paradox\". The classic version asks how many people you need for a greater than 50% chance of *any* two people sharing a birthday.  This question focuses on the probability of two people sharing a birthday *given* that we already have pairs of twins.\n\n**Logic**\n\n* **Twins share birthdays:**  Each pair of twins guarantees a shared birthday. \n* **We need more than just one pair:** A single pair of twins means a 100% chance of a shared birthday within that pair, but we want a 50% chance considering everyone in the room.\n\n**Finding the Threshold**\n\nUnfortunately, there's no simple calculation to pinpoint the exact number of twin pairs needed for a *precisely* 50% chance. The probability becomes increasingly complex with each additional pair.\n\n**Eliminating Options**\n\n* **A. 1 pair:**  As explained above, this is too low.\n* **C. 46 pairs and D. 12 pairs:** These are far too high.  Remember, even with a smaller group of unrelated people, the probability of a shared birthday increases surprisingly fast.\n\n**The Best Answer**\n\nGiven the options, the most logical answer is **B. 23 pairs**.  Here's why:\n\n* **Approximation to the Classic Paradox:** The classic Birthday Paradox finds a >50% chance of a shared birthday with just 23 *people*. While not directly comparable, it suggests that a similar number of *twin pairs* might be in the ballpark for our modified scenario.\n\n**Important Note:** It's crucial to understand that 23 pairs is not a precise answer. The actual number of twin pairs needed for a 50% chance in this scenario would require complex probability calculations.\n\n**JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n\"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n\"EXPLANATION\": \"While there's no easy calculation, we can use logic and the classic Birthday Paradox as a guide. 23 pairs, while not exact, is the most plausible option given the choices.\" \n}\n``` \n","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
