Since your opponent fired and no bullet came out, we know that the chamber he fired was the one empty chamber. This leaves 5 chambers, all of which are now known to contain bullets except for the one that was just fired.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, the revolver is now in a state where there are 5 chambers left, and 4 of them contain bullets. The probability of the next chamber being a bullet is 4\/5.\n\nIf you spin the chambers again, you reset the probabilities to the initial state where there are 6 chambers and 5 bullets. The probability of firing a blank is then 1\/6.\n\nComparing the probabilities:\n- Not spinning: 4\/5 chance of hitting a bullet.\n- Spinning: 5\/6 chance of hitting a bullet, 1\/6 chance of hitting a blank.\n\nSince 1\/6 (spinning) is a lower probability of hitting a bullet than 4\/5 (not spinning), it is safer to spin the chambers again.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to spin the chambers again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Given the constraints:\n\n1. One guardian always tells the truth and guards the death door.\n2. The other guardian always lies and guards the freedom door.\n\nYou can ask a single question to either guardian to determine the correct door. The key is to frame the question in such a way that it accounts for both the truth-teller and the liar.\n\nHere's the question you can ask either guardian:\n\"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would they point to?\"\n\n- If you ask the truth-teller, they will truthfully tell you that the liar would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the liar, they will lie about the truth-teller's response and also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the door they point to will be the death door. Therefore, you should choose the opposite door to ensure your safety.\n\nThus, the minimum number of questions needed is one.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.
