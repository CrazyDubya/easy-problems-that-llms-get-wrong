Each side he walks is 1 kilometer in length, and since he walks four sides, he has walked a total of 4 kilometers. Thus, he is 4 kilometers away from his starting point. \n\nFor the elevation, he starts at 0 meters and gains 300 meters, then 200 more, and finally another 200 meters on the last side, for a total of 700 meters of elevation gain. Therefore, his final elevation is 700 meters, or 700 meters above his starting point. \n\nSo, the man ends up 4 kilometers away from his starting point and at an elevation of 700 meters, which places him at a diagonal position from his starting point. Using the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides of 4km and 0.7km gives us the distance between the man and his starting point: \n\n\\begin{align*}\nc^2 &= a^2 + b^2 \\\\\nc &= \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\\\\nc &= \\sqrt{(4\\text{ km})^2 + (0.7\\text{ km})^2} \\\\\nc &\\approx \\sqrt{16\\text{ km}^2 + 0.49\\text{ km}^2} \\\\\nc &\\approx \\sqrt{16.49\\text{ km}^2} \\\\\nc &\\approx 4.06\\text{ km}\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo, the distance between the man and his starting point is approximately 4.06 kilometers. Since this is the closest he can get to his starting point (0 meters) at the given elevation of 700 meters, the final answer is approximately **2000 meters** away from the starting point.","score":""},"14":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A group of four people needs to cross a bridge at night.

This approach leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it can be done:\n\nAllocate a unique number to each of the 10 prisoners, from 0 to 9. These numbers represent the binary digits (bits) that can be combined to represent all the bottles of wine.

If the prisoner survives, you know the poison is not in those bottles.\n\nMove to the next bit (bit 1) and allocate those bottles to prisoner 1. If the first prisoner survived, prisoner 1 tastes the second group of 250 bottles (from bottle 500 to 749). If the first prisoner died, prisoner 1 tastes the first group of 250 bottles (from bottle 0 to 249). This way, you are narrowing down the range of possible bottles.\n\nContinue this process, adjusting the range of bottles tested based on the survival or death of the previous prisoner. With each step, you are effectively dividing the remaining bottles in half.\n\nAfter 10 steps (using all 10 prisoners), you will have tested all 1000 bottles. The binary representation of the bottles will indicate which one is poisoned. For example, if prisoners 3, 5, and 10 die, the binary representation 0110010011 points to bottle number 467 as the poisoned one.\n\nThis binary search strategy ensures that you only need to test each bottle once and can identify the poisoned wine within 24 hours.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

The 'birthday problem' calculates the probability that, in a set of randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday. \n\nThe formula to calculate the probability (P) of people having the same birthday in a group of size n is:\n\nP = 1 - (L \/ L) * (L-1 \/ L-1) * ... * (L-n+1 \/ L-n+1)\n\nWhere:\n- L is the number of days in a year, assuming a leap year with 366 days.\n\nTo find the number of pairs of twins required for a 50% probability, we can use the formula and work backwards:\n\nP(50%) = 1 - (366 \/ 366) * (365 \/ 366) * ... = 0.5\n\nSolving for n (the number of people), we find that n = 23. This means, for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday in a room, you would need **23 pairs of twins**.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Option D is also inefficient as it only fills the 4-gallon jug with 2 gallons of water.\n\nThe most efficient solution is to not choose any of the provided options.
