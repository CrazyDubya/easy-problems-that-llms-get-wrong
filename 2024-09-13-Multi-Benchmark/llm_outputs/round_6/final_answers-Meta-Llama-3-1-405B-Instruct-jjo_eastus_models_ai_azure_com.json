Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"This problem is a variation of the classic Monty Hall problem. The key to understanding the solution lies in recognizing that the host's action of offering a switch is not random; it is based on his knowledge of what's behind the doors.\n\nInitially, when you choose a door, say No. 1, there is a 1\/3 chance that the gold bar is behind that door and a 2\/3 chance that it is behind one of the other two doors. The host then asks if you want to switch to door No. 2. The critical point here is that the host knows what's behind the doors and will only offer you a switch if door No. 2 does not have the gold bar. This means that if you switch to door No. 2, you effectively still have a 1\/3 chance of winning because the host would not offer you a switch if door No. 2 had the gold bar.\n\nHowever, since the host's offer doesn't change the initial probability distribution from your perspective (1\/3 for the door you chose and 2\/3 for the other two doors combined), and since you know the host won't offer a switch to the door with the gold bar, the 2\/3 probability of the gold bar being behind one of the other two doors doesn't change. But since you can't choose door No. 2 (because the host's offer implies it doesn't have the gold bar), the 2\/3 probability effectively transfers to door No. 3.\n\nTherefore, switching to door No. 3 gives you a 2\/3 chance of winning, which is a bigger advantage than sticking with your original choice, door No. 1, which only has a 1\/3 chance of winning.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This means there is only 1 empty chamber.\n\n2. **Opponent's Turn**: When your opponent spins the chambers and fires at himself but no bullet comes out, it means he has found the only empty chamber. At this point, the revolver's configuration is such that 5 out of the 6 chambers are known to be loaded, and the chamber that was just fired from is known to be empty.\n\n3. **Your Turn**: Now, it's your turn, and you have the option to spin the chambers again or not before firing at yourself.\n\n- **If You Don't Spin Again**: Since the empty chamber has already been identified and used, you know that all 5 remaining chambers are loaded with bullets. This means if you fire without spinning, you have a 100% chance of firing a bullet.\n\n- **If You Spin Again**: Spinning the chambers again randomizes the position of the bullets and the empty chamber.

This means that modern technical terms, scientific jargon, and words borrowed from other languages after the 17th century are less likely to appear in The Bible.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Quixotic zephyrs vexed the jabberwocky's kumquat garden.\n- \"Quixotic\" refers to the character Don Quixote and is a post-Biblical word.\n- \"Zephyrs\" is a word that appears in various forms in The Bible (e.g., \"west wind\" in Exodus 10:19, though not exactly as \"zephyr\").\n- \"Jabberwocky\" is a nonsense word from a 19th-century poem by Lewis Carroll, definitely not in The Bible.\n- \"Kumquat\" is a fruit not mentioned in The Bible.\n\nB.

The goal is to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours.\n\nOption A suggests dividing the bottles among the prisoners and seeing who dies. This method does not guarantee finding the poisoned bottle with just 10 prisoners, as it implies each prisoner would have to drink from 100 bottles (1000 bottles \/ 10 prisoners), and if more than one prisoner dies, you wouldn't know which bottle was responsible.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the poison is described as taking effect 24 hours after consumption, with no mention of an immediate bitter taste that could be detected by the prisoners.\n\nOption D, having all prisoners sample each bottle, is impractical and dangerous, ensuring the death of all prisoners and not providing a clear indication of which bottle is poisoned.\n\nOption B, using a binary search strategy, is the most efficient method. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number from 0000000000 to 1111111111 (10 digits, representing the 10 prisoners, allowing for 2^10 = 1024 combinations, which is more than enough for 1000 bottles).\n\n2. Each prisoner corresponds to a digit in the binary number. If the digit is 1, the prisoner drinks from that bottle. If it's 0, they don't.\n\n3. After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died. Their corresponding digits in the binary number are set to 1, and the rest are set to 0. This binary number will directly point to the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that with just 10 prisoners, the king can identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours, as it leverages the power of binary numbers to encode a large amount of information (the identity of the poisoned bottle) in a minimal number of tests.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

The key here is understanding that with each additional person (or pair of twins, in this case), the probability that no one shares a birthday decreases because the number of possible unique birthdays (365, ignoring February 29th for simplicity) is finite.\n\nGiven that each pair of twins by definition shares a birthday, we actually need to consider the number of unique birthdays needed to reach a point where the probability of no shared birthdays among individuals not in the same twin pair is less than 50%.\n\nHowever, the question simplifies to understanding that with pairs of twins, each pair represents a single unique birthday. So, essentially, we're looking for the number of unique birthdays (pairs of twins) needed such that the probability of any two individuals (not in the same pair) sharing a birthday is at least 50%.\n\nThe classic \"birthday problem\" tells us that in a room of 23 people, there's a greater than 50% chance that at least two people share a birthday. Since each pair of twins counts as one unique birthday, we translate this directly to pairs of twins without needing to adjust for the fact they're pairs because the critical factor is the number of unique birthdays.\n\nTherefore, considering the unique birthdays represented by pairs of twins, the number needed for at least a 50% chance that two people (not in the same pair) have the same birthday is equivalent to the number of individuals in the classic birthday problem.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

In the original formulation, a runaway trolley is headed towards a group of five people who cannot move and will be killed if the trolley continues on its course. However, you are standing next to a lever that controls a switch that can divert the trolley onto a side track, where only one person is standing. The dilemma arises because you must decide whether to do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people or pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Given Scenario**: The scenario provided in the question seems to be a variation of the classic trolley problem, but it lacks a crucial piece of information: the presence of anyone on the alternative track. Without this information, we can only speculate on the impact of pulling the lever on the five people's lives based on the original problem's logic.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - **A. Pulling the lever will save their lives.** This is the most logical choice based on the original trolley problem's framework, assuming that diverting the trolley would indeed prevent it from harming the five people.\n   - **B. Pulling the lever will take their lives.** This option contradicts the basic premise of the trolley problem, where the action of pulling the lever is intended to save the lives of the people on the original track.\n   - **C. This is an ethical dilemma.** While this statement is true, it does not directly answer the question about the impact of pulling the lever on the five people's lives.\n   - **D. It doesn't impact their lives.** This option is incorrect because, in the context of the trolley problem, the action of pulling the lever is specifically aimed at changing the course of events that would otherwise lead to the death of the five people.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the logic of the original trolley problem and the information provided, the most appropriate answer is that pulling the lever would save the lives of the five people, assuming there is no one on the alternative track or that the question's focus remains on the impact to the five individuals mentioned.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"27":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"How do you efficiently measure exactly 4 gallons of water with only a 3-gallon, 5-gallon, 4-gallon, and 2-gallon jug?","human_answer":"Fill up the 4-gallon jug","correct_answer":"Another option not stated.","multiple_choice":["Filling the 2-gallon jug, twice.","Filling the 5-gallon jug and pouring it into the 3-gallon jug, twice.","Another option not stated.","Filling the 5-gallon jug and pouring it into the 4-gallon jug."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nHow do you efficiently measure exactly 4 gallons of water with only a 3-gallon, 5-gallon, 4-gallon, and 2-gallon jug?\n\nANSWERS\nA.

Therefore, the soil's weight decreases by 1kg.\n\nSo, if we start with 10kg of soil and 1kg is used for the tree's growth, we subtract this 1kg from the original weight of the soil:\n\n10kg (original soil weight) - 1kg (used for tree growth) = 9kg\n\nTherefore, after the tree grows to 3kg, there is 9kg of soil left.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"29":{"category":"Relational","question":"A man steps over a 0.5m hurdle.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"To determine the minimum height the man could have jumped, we need to consider the mechanics of jumping and clearing an obstacle. When someone jumps over a hurdle, their center of mass (or the average location of their total mass) must clear the top of the hurdle for them to successfully jump over it without touching or falling back. However, the actual height to which a person jumps (measured from the ground to the bottom of their feet at the peak of their jump) is not the same as the height of the hurdle they clear because the height of their jump includes the height of their body from their feet to their center of mass.\n\nGiven that the hurdle is 0.5m high, the man's center of mass must clear this height. However, the question asks for the minimum height he \"could have jumped,\" which refers to the vertical displacement of his feet from the ground, not the height his center of mass reaches. Since a person's center of mass is generally located around the abdominal region when standing upright, and considering the average height of an adult male, the vertical distance from the feet to the center of mass is typically greater than 0.5m. \n\nHowever, the question is about the minimum height he could have jumped to clear the hurdle, not the height of his center of mass. To clear a 0.5m hurdle, he doesn't necessarily need to jump 0.5m; he just needs to ensure his body clears the hurdle. Given the mechanics of human movement and the fact that one can lift a leg over an obstacle without necessarily elevating their entire body to the same height, the actual minimum height he needs to jump is slightly less than the height of the hurdle because he can angle his body and use his legs' length to his advantage.\n\nTherefore, the minimum height he could have jumped is slightly less than the height of the hurdle, but since this specific reasoning isn't directly listed in the options, and considering practical implications of human movement and the phrasing of the options, the closest answer that reflects the necessity of clearing the hurdle while acknowledging the complexity of human movement would be \"slightly higher than 0.5m\" to ensure clearance, especially considering the height of the hurdle as a baseline for necessary clearance and accounting for any minor miscalculations in the explanation regarding center of mass and body positioning.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"30":{"category":"Popular science","question":"I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the goal**: The goal is to find the speed at which you must return from your friend's house to double your average speed for the entire trip. The trip consists of two equal parts: going to your friend's house and coming back.\n\n2. **Initial speed and average speed**: You walk to your friend's house at 3mph. To double your average speed for the entire trip, your average speed needs to be 6mph (since 2 * 3 = 6).\n\n3. **Calculating the return speed**: Let's denote the speed at which you run back as \\(R\\). The total distance for the round trip is twice the distance one way. Since the distance is the same for each leg of the trip, we can simplify our calculation by considering the time it takes for each leg.\n\n   - Time taken to walk to your friend's house at 3mph: Let's say the one-way distance is \\(D\\). So, the time taken to walk there is \\(D \/ 3\\).\n   - Time taken to run back at \\(R\\) mph: The time taken to run back would be \\(D \/ R\\).\n\n4. **Average speed formula**: The average speed for the entire trip is the total distance divided by the total time. The formula for average speed (\\(S_{avg}\\)) is:\n   \\[\n   S_{avg} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n   \\]\n   For our case, the total distance is \\(2D\\) (there and back), and the total time is \\(D \/ 3 + D \/ R\\). We want \\(S_{avg}\\) to be 6mph.\n\n5. **Setting up the equation**: Plugging in the values, we get:\n   \\[\n   6 = \\frac{2D}{\\frac{D}{3} + \\frac{D}{R}}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   6\\left(\\frac{D}{3} + \\frac{D}{R}\\right) = 2D\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2D + \\frac{6D}{R} = 2D\n   \\]\n   Subtracting \\(2D\\) from both sides gives us:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6D}{R} = 0\n   \\]\n   This implies that \\(R\\) must be infinitely large to satisfy the equation, which doesn't make practical sense but is the mathematical outcome of our setup.\n\nGiven the above explanation, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""}}
