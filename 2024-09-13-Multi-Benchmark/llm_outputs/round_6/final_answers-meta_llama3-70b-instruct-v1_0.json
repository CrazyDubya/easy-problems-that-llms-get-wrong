This way, we can determine which switch controls which bulb. For example, if we turn switch A on and the red bulb lights up, we know that switch A controls the red bulb. Then, we can turn switch A off and turn switch B on. If the blue bulb lights up, we know that switch B controls the blue bulb. Finally, we can turn switch B off and turn switch C on.

Option B is not feasible as it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is impractical. Options C and D are also not optimal as they don't utilize the prisoners' \"testing capacity\" efficiently.\n\nThe correct approach is to use a binary search strategy, which is Option A. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle of wine with a binary number from 0 to 999 (using 10 binary digits, since 2^10 = 1024 > 1000).\n2. Assign each prisoner a unique binary number from 0 to 9 (using 4 binary digits, since 2^4 = 16 > 10).\n3. For each bottle, if the i-th binary digit is 1, the prisoner with the corresponding binary number i will drink from that bottle.\n4. After 24 hours, the king will know which prisoners have died.\n5. By analyzing the binary numbers of the dead prisoners, the king can determine the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 5 die, the king can deduce that the poisoned bottle has a binary number with the 1st, 3rd, and 5th digits set to 1.

This is because there are more opportunities for birthdays to overlap.\n\nUsing the formula for the birthday problem, we can calculate the probability that at least two people share a birthday as:\n\nP(at least two share a birthday) = 1 - P(no one shares a birthday)\n\nwhere P(no one shares a birthday) is the probability that all pairs of twins have distinct birthdays.\n\nAfter some calculations, we find that with 23 pairs of twins (46 people), the probability that at least two people share a birthday is approximately 50.7%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

If we ask each current guest to move to the room number n*2, we effectively free up all the odd-numbered rooms.
