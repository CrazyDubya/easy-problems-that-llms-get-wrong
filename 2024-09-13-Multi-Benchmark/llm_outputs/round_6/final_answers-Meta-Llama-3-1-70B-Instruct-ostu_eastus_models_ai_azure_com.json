From his perspective, each box has an equal chance of containing something desirable (like money), something undesirable (like an explosion), or nothing at all. Without any information to guide his decision, the choice seems random.\n\n2. **Colin's Knowledge**: We know that Colin is aware of the contents of each box. Specifically, Box A will explode, Box B contains $5, and Box C is empty. This information is crucial for making an informed decision, but it's not available to Bob.\n\n3. **Decision Making**: Since Bob lacks the information that Colin has, Bob's decision should be based on the principle of minimizing risk or maximizing potential gain without any specific knowledge. However, without knowing the contents, the decision is essentially a gamble.\n\n4. **Considering the Options**:\n   - **A. Yes, Box C**: This is the safest option based on Colin's knowledge, but Bob doesn't have this information. From Bob's perspective, choosing Box C over the others is not more rational without additional information.\n   - **B. No, Bob should not open any box**: This option avoids any potential risk but also any potential reward. It's a conservative approach but doesn't take into account the possibility of gaining something positive.\n   - **C. Yes, Box B**: This is the option that would yield a positive outcome based on Colin's knowledge, but again, Bob doesn't have this information. It's as much a gamble as choosing Box A or Box C.\n   - **D. Yes, Box A**: This option carries the highest risk based on Colin's knowledge but is not distinguishable from the other options from Bob's perspective.\n\nGiven the lack of information available to Bob and the fact that each box represents an equal gamble from his perspective, the decision to open a box or not, and which one to open, is essentially arbitrary without additional information.

This can be achieved by asking a question that is self-referential, i.e., a question that refers to the guardian's own statement.\n\nHere's the question: \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\nThink about it for a moment...\n\nIf the guardian you ask is the truth-teller, they will tell you what the liar would say, which is the wrong door. If the guardian you ask is the liar, they will lie about what the truth-teller would say, which is also the wrong door.\n\nIn either case, the answer you get will steer you away from the door that leads to freedom. So, you can safely assume the opposite door is the one that leads to freedom.\n\nThis means you only need to ask one question to determine which door leads to freedom.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

This option is not efficient, as it would require each prisoner to taste a large number of bottles, and even then, it's not guaranteed that the poisoned bottle would be identified.\n\nB. This option is not feasible, as the poison is not immediately bitter, but rather takes effect after 24 hours.\n\nD. This option is not practical, as it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is not possible in 24 hours.\n\nC. This option is the most promising. By using a binary search strategy, the king can minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n* Assign a unique binary number to each bottle of wine, using 10 digits (since there are 10 prisoners).\n* Each prisoner corresponds to a digit in the binary number.\n* For each bottle, the prisoner corresponding to the digit in the binary number takes a sip of the wine if the digit is 1, and doesn't take a sip if the digit is 0.\n* After 24 hours, the prisoners who have taken the poison will die.\n* By analyzing which prisoners have died, the king can reconstruct the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 5 have died, the binary number of the poisoned bottle is 1010100000.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in 24 hours using only 10 prisoners.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

The minimum height they could have jumped is not simply the height of the hurdle because, at the very least, they need to clear the top of the hurdle to avoid touching it.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the \"minimum height he could have jumped,\" which implies the lowest possible height that still allows him to clear the hurdle. This would be slightly higher than the height of the hurdle itself because, in theory, the man could jump in such a way that he barely clears the top of the hurdle. This means the minimum height is not exactly the height of the hurdle but slightly more than that to ensure clearance.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. 0.5m - This is the height of the hurdle, but it doesn't account for the need to clear it.\nB. 0m - This is not possible as the man must jump higher than the ground to clear the hurdle.\nC. Slightly higher than 0.5m - This accounts for the need to clear the hurdle, making it the most logical choice.\nD. Between 0.1m and 0.5m - This range includes heights that are lower than necessary to clear the hurdle.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"30":{"category":"Popular science","question":"I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.

Since the distance to and from your friend's house is the same, let's denote this distance as D. The time taken to walk to your friend's house at 3mph is D\/3. \n\n3. **Calculating the Required Speed**: To double the average speed for the entire trip, the new average speed needs to be 6mph (since 2 * 3mph = 6mph). The total time for the round trip at this new average speed would be 2D\/6, which simplifies to D\/3.\n\n4. **Finding the Running Speed**: Since the total time for the round trip at the new average speed is D\/3, and the time taken to walk to your friend's house is also D\/3, the time left for the return trip (running) must be 0. This implies that you would have to run infinitely fast to cover the distance in zero time, which is not physically possible but is the theoretical answer based on the given conditions.\n\n5. **Selecting the Answer**: Based on the above reasoning, the correct answer is that you would have to run infinitely fast to double your average speed for the entire trip.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""}}
