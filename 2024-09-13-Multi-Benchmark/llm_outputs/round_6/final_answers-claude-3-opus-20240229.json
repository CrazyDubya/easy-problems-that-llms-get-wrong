The key is that the host knows what's behind the doors and always opens a door with rotten vegetables after you make your initial pick.\n\nInitially, you have a 1\/3 chance of picking the gold bar. The probability the gold is behind one of the other doors is 2\/3.\n\nWhen the host opens a door with rotten vegetables, he is giving you additional information.

The king can number the bottles from 1 to 1000 and represent each number in binary using the 10 prisoners. Each prisoner is assigned a bit position. For example, prisoner 1 drinks from every bottle whose binary representation has a 1 in the 1's place, prisoner 2 drinks if there is a 1 in the 2's place, and so on. After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank the poison will have died. By looking at which prisoners died, the king can determine the binary representation of the poisoned bottle's number.
