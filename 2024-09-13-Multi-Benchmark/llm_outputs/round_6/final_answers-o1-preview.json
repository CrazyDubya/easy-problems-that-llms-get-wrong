After you pick Door No.1, the host offers you the option to switch to Door No.2. This situation is a variation of the classic Monty Hall problem.\n\nIn the traditional Monty Hall problem, the host, who knows what is behind each door, always opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat (or, in this case, rotten vegetables) and then offers you the chance to switch to the remaining unopened door. The key factor is that the host's actions provide additional information because they never reveal the prize behind the doors they open.\n\nIn this variation, the host is giving you a specific option to switch to Door No.2 without revealing what is behind any other door. If we assume that the host is acting strategically and knows where the gold bar is, offering you Door No.2 could be a hint that the gold bar is behind that door. There is no reason for the host to favor Door No.2 unless it increases the excitement of the game or the chances of you winning.\n\nAlternatively, if the host always offers the option to switch to Door No.2 regardless of your initial choice, then there is no advantage in switching, as all doors would have an equal probability.\n\nHowever, given that the host specifically offers Door No.2 and not Door No.3, and assuming the host knows the location of the prize and is intentionally providing you an opportunity, switching to Door No.2 gives you the biggest advantage.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This means that while on the boat, any combination of the wolf, goat, and cabbage can be safely transported together because the compartments prevent them from interacting.\n   - The boat can accommodate all three items **simultaneously**, along with the farmer.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n- Since the boat can carry all three items at once in secure compartments, the farmer can load the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage into the boat and transport them to the other side of the river in **one crossing**.\n- There are no issues on either shore during this operation:\n  - **Starting Shore:** The farmer is present, so no eating occurs before departure.\n  - **Boat Crossing:** The secure compartments prevent any animal from eating another.\n  - **Destination Shore:** Upon arrival, the farmer is still present with all the items, so no eating occurs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe minimum number of crossings required is **one**, as the farmer can safely transport all three items together in a single trip using the boat's secure compartments.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"5":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"Bob has three boxes in front of him - Box A, Box B and Box C.
