By assigning each prisoner a unique 'binary digit' and having them sample wine from bottles corresponding to their assigned digit, the combination of prisoners who die will reveal the binary number of the poisoned bottle. With 10 prisoners, this allows testing up to 1024 bottles (2^10) in a single 24 hour period, which is enough to cover the 1000 bottles. This is much faster than having prisoners divide and sample all 1000 bottles individually.\",\n  \"ANSWER\": \"C\"\n}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

To double my average speed for the entire trip, the total time taken should be half of the time taken to walk one way, i.e., d\/6 hours.\n4.
