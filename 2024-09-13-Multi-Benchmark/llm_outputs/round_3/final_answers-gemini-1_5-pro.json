Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **A is incorrect** because the poison is tasteless (\"sweet bottles of wine\").\n* **B is incorrect** because it's impossible for each prisoner to sample 1000 bottles in 24 hours.\n* **D is incorrect** because it would lead to the death of all prisoners who sampled from the poisoned bottle. \n\n**Explanation of Binary Search Strategy:**\n\n1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each bottle a number from 1 to 1000. Convert each bottle's number into its binary representation (e.g., Bottle 1 is 0000000001, Bottle 2 is 0000000010, Bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.).\n2. **Prisoner Assignment:** Each prisoner represents a specific digit position in the binary numbers (e.g., Prisoner 1 represents the ones place, Prisoner 2 represents the twos place, Prisoner 3 represents the fours place, and so on).\n3. **Tasting Protocol:**  Each prisoner will sip from all bottles where their corresponding binary digit is a \"1\". For example:\n    * Prisoner 1 drinks from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7... (all odd-numbered bottles)\n    * Prisoner 2 drinks from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11... \n    * and so on.\n4. **Decoding the Result:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died. Construct the binary number where a \"1\" represents a dead prisoner and a \"0\" represents a living prisoner. This binary number directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle number.\n\n**Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0010000001, which translates to decimal number 513. Therefore, bottle 513 is poisoned.\n\n**Why Binary Search Works:** This method works because 10 prisoners can represent up to 1024 (2^10) unique combinations with their life or death, allowing you to test a large number of bottles efficiently. \n\n**JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
