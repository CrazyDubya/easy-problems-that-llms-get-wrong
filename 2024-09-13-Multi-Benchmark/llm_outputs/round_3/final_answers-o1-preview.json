The fact that no bullet came out means the gun fired the empty chamber.\n- Revolvers typically advance to the next chamber after each trigger pull.\n- This means that if you do not spin again, the next chamber in line is one of the five loaded ones.\n- **Therefore, if you do not spin, there is a 100% chance that the next chamber contains a bullet**, leading to an unfortunate outcome.\n\n**With Spinning Again:**\n\n- By spinning the chambers, you randomize the position of the cylinder.\n- Each chamber has an equal probability of aligning with the firing mechanism.\n- There is one empty chamber out of six.\n- **Therefore, by spinning again, you have a 1 in 6 chance (approximately 16.67%) of aligning the empty chamber and surviving.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSpinning the chambers again gives you a better chance of survival (approximately 16.67%) compared to not spinning (0% chance).
