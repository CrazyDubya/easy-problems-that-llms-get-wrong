Using a binary search strategy is the optimal approach. The bottles can be divided into 10 groups (since there are 10 prisoners), and the prisoners each assigned to sample from a different group. Based on which prisoners die, the specific poisoned bottle can be determined, as if the bottle numbers are represented in binary. This will definitively identify the single poisoned bottle in 24 hours with minimal loss of life.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
