Your opponent spins the chambers, fires at himself, and survives. This means the empty chamber was just fired.\n\nIf you choose **not** to spin again, the revolver's cylinder remains in the same position it was after your opponent's turn. In most revolvers, pulling the trigger advances the cylinder to the next chamber. Since the empty chamber has just been used, the next chamber must be one of the five loaded ones. This means you have a 100% chance of firing a bullet if you don't spin again.\n\nBy choosing to spin the chambers again, you reset the cylinder's position, giving you a 1 in 6 chance (approximately 16.7%) of landing on the empty chamber and surviving.
