So, we need at least two races to determine the fastest horse.\n\n4. Here's an efficient strategy:\n   - Race 1: Run all 6 horses. This gives us the order of the top 3.\n   - Race 2: Take the 4th place horse from Race 1, and race it with the 2nd and 3rd place horses from Race 1.\n\n5. After these two races, we can determine the fastest horse:\n   - If the winner of Race 1 is faster than the winner of Race 2, it's the fastest overall.\n   - If the winner of Race 2 beats the 2nd place horse from Race 1, it's the fastest overall.\n\n6.
