Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n\nExplanation:\nThe fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from one bottle in their group.\n3. Wait 24 hours to see which prisoner, if any, dies.\n4. If a prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in their group. If no one dies, then the poisoned bottle is in the remaining 900 bottles.\n5. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles, dividing them into 9 groups of 100 bottles each and assigning them to the remaining prisoners.\n6. Continue this process until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle with the fewest number of tests possible, using only 10 prisoners. It also ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours, which is critical for the event.\n\nOption A is not feasible because it would require all 1000 bottles to be tested, which would take too long and potentially harm all of the prisoners. Option B is not optimal because it does not minimize the number of tests needed. Option D is not reliable because the poison may not have a noticeable taste.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"The question you're asking is a variation of the classic birthday problem, which asks for the probability that in a group of randomly selected people some pair of them will have the same birthday. However, your question is about pairs of twins, which makes it a bit different.\n\nSince twins share the same birthday, every pair of twins you add to the room increases the total number of people by 2, but only adds 1 unique birthday to the room.\n\nThe probability of having at least one pair of people with the same birthday increases as the number of unique birthdays decreases. In this case, we want to find the number of pairs of twins needed to have at least a 50% chance that two people (who are not twins) have the same birthday.\n\nLet's denote the number of pairs of twins as n. The total number of people in the room would then be 2n, and the number of unique birthdays would be n.\n\nThe probability that all 2n people have different birthdays (excluding the twins themselves) is given by the formula:\n\nP(different birthdays) = (364\/365) * (363\/365) * ... * ((365-2n+1)\/365)\n\nWe want to find the smallest n such that P(different birthdays) < 0.5.\n\nThis is a complex calculation that would typically be done using a computer program or a calculator that can handle permutations and combinations. However, based on the standard birthday problem, which states that you only need 23 people for there to be a 50% chance of a shared birthday, we can infer that the number of pairs of twins needed would be less than 23, because each pair of twins effectively counts as 1 person towards the shared birthday probability.\n\nHowever, since the options provided are all multiples of pairs, and considering the logic above, the correct answer would be the one that corresponds to the least number of pairs that would still give us a probability of at least 50%.\n\nGiven the options, the correct answer would be:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n\nThis is because 23 pairs of twins would result in 46 people in the room, which is more than enough to have a 50% chance of a shared birthday between non-twin individuals.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
