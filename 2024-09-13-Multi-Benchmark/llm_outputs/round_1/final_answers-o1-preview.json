        "model_answer": "To determine how much soil is left when the tree grows from 2kg to 3kg, we need to consider where the additional mass of the tree comes from. \n\nTrees primarily gain mass through the process of photosynthesis, where they convert carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil into organic matter. The carbon from carbon dioxide contributes significantly to the tree's biomass, not the soil. The soil provides minerals and nutrients but doesn't lose significant mass in the process.\n\nTherefore, even though the tree has increased in mass by 1kg, the soil's mass remains virtually unchanged at 10kg.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}",
