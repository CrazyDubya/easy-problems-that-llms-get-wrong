This ensures that the goat is not left alone with either the wolf or the cabbage. (1 crossing)\n2. The farmer returns alone to the original shore to get either the wolf or the cabbage. Let's say he takes the wolf next. (2 crossings)\n3. The farmer leaves the wolf on the other shore but takes the goat back with him to the original shore. This is because leaving the wolf and the goat together would result in the goat being eaten. (3 crossings)\n4. The farmer then takes the cabbage across the river, leaving it with the wolf. Since the wolf does not eat cabbage, this is safe. (4 crossings)\n5. Finally, the farmer returns alone to the original shore to get the goat and brings it across the river.

By leveraging the concept of binary numbers, each prisoner can be thought of as representing a digit in a 10-digit binary number. Each bottle of wine is assigned a unique number from 1 to 1000, converted into binary. The prisoners will then drink from bottles according to the binary digits (1 for drink, 0 for not drink) across all the bottles. After 24 hours, the combination of which prisoners get poisoned (represented as 1s) and which do not (represented as 0s) will directly point to the poisoned bottle when the binary number is converted back to decimal. This method minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures the identification of the poisoned bottle within the 24-hour constraint, making it the most efficient strategy among the given options.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

The traditional answer to the classic problem is 23 people, not considering leap years or twins.\n\nHowever, the question here specifically asks about pairs of twins. Each pair of twins shares the same birthday, so the probability aspect of the question changes. Since each pair of twins already shares a birthday, the question essentially becomes how many distinct birthdays you need to have a greater than 50% chance of a match in a group, which is the same logic as the classic problem but applied differently.\n\nFor the classic birthday problem, the calculation starts with the probability that two people do not share a birthday and subtracts that from 100% to find the probability that they do. With twins, each pair counts as a single unique birthday in this context, so the calculation for the number of pairs needed to reach a 50% chance of a shared birthday among any two pairs (or any two people from different pairs) is the same as the number of individuals in the classic problem.\n\nTherefore, since 23 individuals create a scenario where there is at least a 50% chance that two people share the same birthday, you would also need 23 pairs of twins for there to be at least a 50% chance that two pairs of twins (or individuals from different pairs) share the same birthday.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"To solve this problem, let's first understand what is being asked. The question is about doubling the average speed for the entire trip, which includes both walking to the friend's house and running back.\n\nLet's denote:\n- The distance to the friend's house as \\(D\\) miles.\n- The walking speed as 3 mph.\n- The running speed back as \\(R\\) mph.\n\nThe time taken to walk to the friend's house is \\(T_{walk} = \\frac{D}{3}\\) hours.\n\nThe question asks for the speed to run back that would double the average speed of the entire trip. The average speed for the entire trip is calculated as the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance for the round trip is \\(2D\\) miles.\n\nIf the average speed for the entire trip needs to be doubled compared to the walking speed, the new average speed should be \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) mph.\n\nThe formula for average speed is:\n\\[Average\\ Speed = \\frac{Total\\ Distance}{Total\\ Time}\\]\n\nGiven that the desired average speed is 6 mph for a total distance of \\(2D\\), we can write:\n\\[6 = \\frac{2D}{Total\\ Time}\\]\n\nThe total time is the sum of the time walking and running, which is:\n\\[Total\\ Time = T_{walk} + T_{run} = \\frac{D}{3} + \\frac{D}{R}\\]\n\nSubstituting the total time in the average speed equation gives:\n\\[6 = \\frac{2D}{\\frac{D}{3} + \\frac{D}{R}}\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[6 = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{R}}\\]\n\nFurther simplification leads to:\n\\[6 = \\frac{2}{\\frac{R + 3}{3R}}\\]\n\n\\[6 = \\frac{6R}{R + 3}\\]\n\n\\[6R + 18 = 6R\\]\n\nThis equation suggests that no matter what \\(R\\) is, you cannot simply double the average speed of the entire trip by adjusting the speed of the return trip alone, given the way average speed works over a fixed distance. The calculation above leads to an inconsistency because it incorrectly suggests that any speed \\(R\\) would work, which is not the case given the premise of the problem.\n\nThe correct interpretation is that to double the average speed of the entire trip to 6 mph, considering the constraints of the problem, it's not about finding a specific speed \\(R\\) but understanding the nature of average speeds. The correct answer is that it's impossible to achieve this by running back at any finite speed because the time spent walking at 3 mph has already set a lower average speed that cannot be doubled simply by increasing the return speed over the same distance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""}}
