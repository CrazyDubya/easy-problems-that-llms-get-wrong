The wolf poses a danger to the goat, and the goat poses a danger to the cabbage. So, we need to ensure that these pairs are never left alone together on either shore.\n\nOne possible solution:\n1. First crossing: The farmer takes the goat over and leaves it on the other side, then returns alone.\n2. Second crossing: The farmer takes the wolf and brings it across, leaving it with the goat.
