We need to identify which guard is the truthful one and which is the liar.\n2. We also need to determine which door leads to freedom.\n3. We can accomplish both of these tasks with a single, carefully crafted question.\n\nThe key is to ask a question that will give us different answers from the truthful and lying guards, while also revealing which door leads to freedom. Here's such a question:\n\n\"If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\nHere's why this works:\n\n- If you're asking the truthful guard, they will truthfully tell you what the lying guard would say, which would be the wrong door (death).\n- If you're asking the lying guard, they will lie about what the truthful guard would say, which would also be the wrong door (death).\n\nSo, regardless of which guard you ask, the answer will always point to the death door. Therefore, you should choose the opposite door to find freedom.\n\nThis solves the puzzle with just one question, allowing you to determine which door leads to freedom without needing to know which guard is which.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.
