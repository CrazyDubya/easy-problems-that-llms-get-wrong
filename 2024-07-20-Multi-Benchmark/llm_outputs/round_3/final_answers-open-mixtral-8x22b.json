This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from one bottle in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoner, if any, dies.\n4. If a prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in their group. If no prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in the remaining 900 bottles.\n5. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles, dividing them into 9 groups of 100 bottles each and assigning them to the remaining prisoners.\n6. Continue this process until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time possible, while minimizing the number of prisoners who need to drink the poisoned wine.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
