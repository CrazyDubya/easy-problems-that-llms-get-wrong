This is a binary approach, as each sip either confirms or denies the presence of poison, narrowing down the possibilities with each sip.\n3. **Narrow down the possibilities**: After the first sip, if no adverse reaction occurs, the prisoner moves on to the next bottle. If a bitter taste or adverse reaction occurs, the prisoner stops and notes the bottle number. This process continues for the next 9 bottles, effectively testing 10 bottles per prisoner in a systematic manner.\n4. **Identify the poisoned bottle**: Since the prisoners are testing the bottles in a binary manner, the king will know the exact bottle number that is poisoned within the 24-hour timeframe. This is because the binary search strategy reduces the search space by half with each test, making it possible to test all 1,000 bottles in just 10 tests.\n\nThis approach ensures the efficient utilization of the prisoners, the 24-hour timeframe, and the king's resources, making it the fastest way to identify the poisoned bottle of wine.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

Since the hotel is only partially full, there must be a highest-numbered room that is occupied. To accommodate one more guest, we can ask all the current guests to move to the room with double their current room number. This ensures that there will always be an empty room (the original room number) for the new guest to occupy without causing any inconvenience to the current guests. This strategy effectively makes use of the infinite room numbers to accommodate an additional guest.","score":""},"26":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A runaway trolley is heading down the tracks away from five people upwards of the track.
