The birthday paradox states that in a group of 23 people, there is a greater than 50% chance that at least two people will have the same birthday.\n\nSince each pair of twins counts as two people, we need to find the number of pairs that would give us at least 23 individuals.\n\nLet \\( n \\) be the number of pairs of twins. Each pair contributes 2 people, so the total number of people is \\( 2n \\).\n\nWe need \\( 2n \\geq 23 \\).\n\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\n\\[ 2n \\geq 23 \\]\n\\[ n \\geq \\frac{23}{2} \\]\n\\[ n \\geq 11.5 \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 12.\n\nTherefore, you need 12 pairs of twins to have at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"C\"\n}\n```","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
