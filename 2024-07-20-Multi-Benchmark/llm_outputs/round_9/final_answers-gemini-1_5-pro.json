Convert each bottle's number into its binary representation (e.g., bottle 1 is 0000000001, bottle 2 is 0000000010, bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.).\n2. **Prisoners as Bits:** Each prisoner represents a specific digit place in the binary numbers (e.g., prisoner 1 represents the ones place, prisoner 2 represents the twos place, prisoner 3 represents the fours place, and so on).\n3. **Wine Assignment:**  Each prisoner will drink from bottles where their corresponding binary digit is a \"1\". For example:\n    * Prisoner 1 drinks from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7... (all odd-numbered bottles)\n    * Prisoner 2 drinks from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11... \n    * Prisoner 3 drinks from bottles 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15...\n4. **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died. Construct a binary number where:\n    * '1' represents a dead prisoner.\n    * '0' represents a living prisoner.\n\n   This binary number will directly correspond to the poisoned bottle number.\n\n**Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0010000001, which translates to decimal number 513. Therefore, bottle 513 is poisoned.\n\n**Why this works:**  Binary representation allows you to test a large number of possibilities with a small number of indicators (prisoners in this case). With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles.\n\n**JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

This is because we're looking at the probability of *any* two people sharing a birthday, not just one specific person matching another.\n\n* **Twins and the Paradox:**  Each pair of twins guarantees a shared birthday.  However, we still need to account for the possibility of *different* pairs of twins also sharing a birthday.
