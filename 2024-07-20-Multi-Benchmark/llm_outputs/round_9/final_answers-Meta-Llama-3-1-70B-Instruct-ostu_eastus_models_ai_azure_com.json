This will give you a ranking of those three horses but won't tell you anything about the other three.\n\n2. **Second Race**: You can race the other three horses against each other. This will give you a ranking of these three horses but still won't tell you how they compare to the first set of three.\n\n3. **Third Race**: Now, you take the winners of the first two races and race them against each other. This will give you the fastest horse overall because you're comparing the fastest from each group.\n\nHowever, this approach assumes you're looking for the absolute fastest horse and doesn't account for determining the full ranking of all six horses. If you only want to know which horse is the fastest, you can actually do it in fewer races by considering a different strategy:\n\n- **Alternative Strategy**: Race all six horses at once.

The probability that the second person has a unique birthday (different from the first person) is 364\/365.

This means the probability of all unique birthdays should be less than or equal to 50%.\n\nUsing the formula above, we can calculate the probability for different numbers of people. However, since we're dealing with pairs of twins, we'll consider the number of pairs instead of individual people.\n\nAfter calculating the probabilities, we find that with 23 pairs of twins (46 people), the probability of all unique birthdays is approximately 0.51, which means the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday is around 49%. With 24 pairs of twins (48 people), the probability of all unique birthdays drops below 0.5, making it more likely than not that at least two people share the same birthday.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the number of pairs of twins needed for at least a 50% chance, we'll round up to the nearest whole number.

This means he can bend his knees, stretch his legs, and lean forward to minimize the height he needs to clear.\n\nGiven this, the minimum height he needs to jump is not necessarily the height of the hurdle itself, as he can use technique to reduce the effective height he needs to clear. However, he cannot avoid lifting his legs and body at all, so the height must be more than zero. The most accurate description is that he needs to jump slightly higher than the height of the hurdle to ensure he clears it, considering the mechanics of stepping over.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"30":{"category":"Popular science","question":"I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.

Since the distance to and from your friend's house is the same, let's denote this distance as D.\n\n3. **Walking to Your Friend's House**: When walking to your friend's house at 3mph, the time taken to cover the distance D is D\/3 hours.\n\n4. **Running Back**: Let's denote the speed at which you run back as S mph. The time taken to cover the distance D while running back is D\/S hours.\n\n5. **Total Time and Distance for the Round Trip**: The total distance for the round trip is 2D. The total time taken for the round trip is (D\/3) + (D\/S) hours.\n\n6. **Doubling the Average Speed**: To double the average speed for the entire trip, the new average speed must be 6mph (since 2 * 3mph = 6mph). Therefore, the total time for the round trip at this new average speed is the total distance divided by the new average speed: 2D \/ 6 = D\/3 hours.\n\n7. **Equating Total Times**: Since the total time for the round trip at the doubled average speed is D\/3 hours, and this is also equal to the sum of the times for walking to your friend's house and running back, we can set up the equation: D\/3 = (D\/3) + (D\/S).\n\n8. **Solving for S**: Simplifying the equation, we subtract D\/3 from both sides to get 0 = D\/S. This implies that S must be infinitely large to make D\/S = 0, since D is not zero (you did travel a distance).\n\nTherefore, the speed at which you would have to run back to double your average speed for the entire trip is infinitely fast.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""}}
