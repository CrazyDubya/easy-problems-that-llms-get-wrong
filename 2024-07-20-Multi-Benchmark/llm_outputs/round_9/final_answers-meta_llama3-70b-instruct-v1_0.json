Since the bulbs are LED and don't get warm when turned on, we can't use temperature to determine which switch controls which bulb.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, as mentioned, the bulbs don't get warm when turned on, so touching them won't provide any useful information.\n\nOption B is unnecessary and doesn't provide any insight into the problem.\n\nOption D is also incorrect because turning all switches on at once won't allow us to determine which switch controls which bulb.\n\nThe correct approach is to turn each switch on one at a time and observe the bulbs. This way, we can identify which switch controls which bulb by process of elimination. For example, if we turn switch A on and the red bulb lights up, we know that switch A controls the red bulb. We can then repeat this process for the remaining switches and bulbs.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"17":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"The Poisoned Wine - A king has 1000 sweet bottles of wine, and one contains a very bitter poison.

Option A is not feasible because the poison takes effect in 24 hours, so the prisoners won't be able to taste the bitterness immediately. Option B is also not practical because it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is not possible in 24 hours. Option C is similar to Option A and also won't work.\n\nThe correct answer is Option D. Here's how the king can use a binary search strategy to identify the poisoned bottle:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into two groups of 500 each.\n2. Have one prisoner drink from each bottle in the first group, and another prisoner drink from each bottle in the second group.\n3. Wait 24 hours. If one prisoner dies, the poisoned bottle is in the group of 500 that the dead prisoner drank from. If both prisoners live, the poisoned bottle is in the other group.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 with the group of 250 bottles (half of the remaining 500), and then with the group of 125 bottles, and so on.\n5. After 10 iterations (since 2^10 = 1024, which is greater than 1000), the king will have identified the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis strategy uses the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.

However, when we add more people to the room, the probability that at least two people share a birthday increases.\n\nWith 23 people in the room (not 23 pairs of twins), the probability that at least two people share a birthday is greater than 50%. This is because there are 23 people, and each person can have one of 365 possible birthdays. As the number of people increases, the number of possible birthday combinations grows exponentially, making it more likely that at least two people share a birthday.\n\nSo, to answer the question, we don't need 23 pairs of twins, but rather just 23 people in the room.

At first glance, it appears to be a simple problem of finding an empty room to accommodate the new guest. However, the phrase \"infinite number of fully furnished rooms\" is a hint that there's more to it.\n\nIf we assume that the hotel is partially full, it means that there are already some guests occupying some of the rooms.

Asking each current guest to move to the room number n*2 would indeed free up the odd-numbered rooms, but it's not necessary to do so.
