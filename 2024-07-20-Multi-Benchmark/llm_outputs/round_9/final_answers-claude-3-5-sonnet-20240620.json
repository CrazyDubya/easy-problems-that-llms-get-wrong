The host, who knows what's behind each door, is offering you the chance to switch to Door No. 2 specifically.\n\n4. This is different from the classic Monty Hall problem, where the host would open a door with a rotten vegetable and then offer you the chance to switch to the remaining unopened door.\n\n5.

We don't know which guard is the truthful one and which is the liar.\n3. We don't know which door leads to freedom and which to death.\n\nThe key is to ask a question that will give us the correct information regardless of which guard we ask. Here's a question that accomplishes this:\n\n\"If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\nHere's why this works:\n- If you ask the truthful guard, they will truthfully tell you what the lying guard would say, which would be the wrong door (death).\n- If you ask the lying guard, they will lie about what the truthful guard would say, which again would be the wrong door (death).\n\nIn both cases, the answer you receive will point to the death door. Therefore, you should choose the opposite door to reach freedom.\n\nThis solves the problem with just one question. You don't need to ask any more questions or determine which guard is which.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of questions needed is one.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.
