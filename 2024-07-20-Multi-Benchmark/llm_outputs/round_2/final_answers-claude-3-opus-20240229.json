It also does not make efficient use of the 10 prisoners.\n\nChoice B leverages a binary search strategy, assigning each bottle a unique 10-digit binary number. Each prisoner is assigned one of the 10 digit places. The prisoners then sample only the bottles that have a 1 in their assigned digit place. After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners that are dead will reveal the binary number of the poisoned bottle.
