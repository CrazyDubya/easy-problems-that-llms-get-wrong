Since the bulbs are LED and don't get warm when turned on, we can't use temperature to determine which switch controls which bulb.\n\nThe best approach is to turn each switch on one at a time and observe the bulbs. This allows us to gather information about which switch controls which bulb without any ambiguity.\n\nHere's how it would work:\n\n1. Turn switch A on and observe the bulbs. If one of them turns on, we know that switch A controls that bulb.\n2. Turn switch A off and turn switch B on. If a different bulb turns on, we know that switch B controls that bulb. If the same bulb turns on, we know that switch B doesn't control that bulb.\n3.

When we add a second person, the probability that they have a different birthday than the first person is 364\/365, since there's one fewer day available. The probability that they have the same birthday is therefore 1 - 364\/365 = 1\/365.\n\nNow, let's add more people to the room. For each additional person, the probability that they have a different birthday than all the previous people is (365 - number of people)\/365. The probability that they have the same birthday as at least one of the previous people is therefore 1 - (365 - number of people)\/365.\n\nUsing this logic, we can calculate the probability that at least two people share a birthday for different numbers of people in the room:\n\n* 2 people: 1\/365\n* 3 people: 1 - (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u2248 0.082\n* 4 people: 1 - (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 (362\/365) \u2248 0.163\n* ...\n* 23 people: 1 - (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 (343\/365) \u2248 0.507\n\nAs we can see, with 23 people in the room, the probability that at least two people share a birthday is greater than 50%.\n\nSince we're asked to find the number of pairs of twins, we need to divide the total number of people by 2.

I walk to my friend's house at 3mph. This means the time it takes to walk to my friend's house is the distance divided by 3mph.\n2. To double my average speed for the entire trip, I need to make the total time for the round trip (walking to my friend's house and running back) equal to half the time it takes to walk to my friend's house.\n3.
