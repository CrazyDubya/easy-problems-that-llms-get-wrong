The probability that the gold bar is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\nWhen the host offers you the chance to switch to Door No. 2, he is implicitly revealing information.

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. You know that one guardian always tells the truth and the other always lies.\n2. The truth-telling guardian is guarding the door to certain death.\n3. The lying guardian is guarding the door to freedom.\n\nYou can ask one question to either guardian to determine the correct door. The key is to ask a question that forces both the truth-teller and the liar to give you the same answer.\n\nThe question you can ask is: \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would they point to?\"\n\n- If you ask the truth-teller, they will truthfully tell you that the liar would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the liar, they will lie about the truth-teller pointing to the freedom door and instead point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the answer you get will point to the death door. Therefore, you should choose the opposite door to ensure your safety.\n\nThus, the minimum number of questions needed is one.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

Given that we have 10 prisoners and 1000 bottles, we can use a binary representation strategy to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nEach bottle can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000). We can assign each prisoner to a specific bit position in these binary numbers.
