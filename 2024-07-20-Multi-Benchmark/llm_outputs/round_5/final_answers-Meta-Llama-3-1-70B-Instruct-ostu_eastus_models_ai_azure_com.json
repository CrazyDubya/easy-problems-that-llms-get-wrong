The probability that the second person has a unique birthday (different from the first person) is 364\/365.

However, you are standing near a lever that controls a switch that can divert the trolley onto a different track. The question typically implies that there is one person on the alternate track who will be killed if the trolley is diverted onto it.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\nA. This is an ethical dilemma.\n- This is correct because the scenario presents a choice between two morally difficult options: allowing the trolley to kill the five people on the original track or actively diverting it to kill one person on the alternate track. Both options involve the death of innocent people, which makes it an ethical dilemma.\n\nB. Pulling the lever will save their lives.\n- This is incorrect because pulling the lever will divert the trolley onto a track where it will kill one person, not save the lives of the five people on the original track. However, it does save the lives of the five people by diverting the trolley away from them.\n\nC.

However, the body's center of mass does not necessarily have to rise to the same height as the foot to clear the obstacle. The man can bend his knees and swing his leg over the hurdle, which means his center of mass (and thus the minimum height he needs to jump) does not have to be as high as the hurdle itself.\n\nHowever, to ensure that the foot clears the hurdle, the man must lift his foot to a height slightly above the hurdle to account for the arc of the step and to ensure clearance. This means the minimum height he could have jumped is slightly higher than the height of the hurdle to ensure his foot clears it.\n\nTherefore, the minimum height he could have jumped is slightly higher than 0.5m.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"30":{"category":"Popular science","question":"I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.

Since the distance to and from your friend's house is the same, let's denote this distance as D.\n\n3. **Walking to Your Friend's House**: When walking at 3mph, the time taken to cover the distance D is D\/3 hours.\n\n4. **Running Back**: Let's denote the speed at which you run back as S mph. The time taken to cover the distance D while running back is D\/S hours.\n\n5. **Total Time and Distance**: The total distance for the round trip is 2D. The total time taken for the round trip is (D\/3) + (D\/S) hours.\n\n6. **Doubling the Average Speed**: To double the average speed for the entire trip, the new average speed needs to be 6mph (since 2 * 3mph = 6mph). Therefore, the total time for the round trip at this new average speed is the total distance divided by the new average speed: 2D \/ 6 = D\/3 hours.\n\n7. **Equating Total Times**: Since the total time for the round trip at the doubled average speed is D\/3 hours, and this is also equal to the sum of the times for walking and running, we can set up the equation: (D\/3) + (D\/S) = D\/3.\n\n8. **Solving for S**: Simplifying the equation, we subtract D\/3 from both sides to get D\/S = 0. This implies that S must be infinitely large to make D\/S = 0, which is a mathematical way of saying that it's impossible to achieve a finite speed that would allow you to double your average speed for the round trip by running back.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""}}
