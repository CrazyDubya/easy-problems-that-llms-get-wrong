The birthday paradox states that in a group of 23 people, there is a greater than 50% chance that at least two people will have the same birthday.\n\nSince each pair of twins counts as two people, we need to find the number of pairs that would give us at least 23 people.\n\nLet \\( n \\) be the number of pairs of twins.
