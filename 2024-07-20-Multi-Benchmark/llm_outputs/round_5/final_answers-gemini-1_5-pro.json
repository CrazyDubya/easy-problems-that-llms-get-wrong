Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10. Convert each prisoner's number into its binary equivalent (e.g., Prisoner 1 is 001, Prisoner 2 is 010, Prisoner 3 is 011, etc.).\n2. **Labeling Bottles:**  Number the wine bottles from 1 to 1000. Convert each bottle's number into its binary equivalent (up to 10 digits, padding with zeros if needed).\n3. **Tasting Strategy:** Each prisoner drinks from bottles where the bottle's binary representation has a \"1\" in the position corresponding to the prisoner's binary number.  For example:\n    * Prisoner 1 (001) drinks from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7... (all odd-numbered bottles)\n    * Prisoner 2 (010) drinks from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11...\n    * Prisoner 3 (011) drinks from bottles 3, 7, 11... \n4. **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died. Construct a binary number where \"1\" represents a dead prisoner and \"0\" represents a living prisoner. This binary number directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle number.\n\n**Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0100100000, which translates to decimal number 576. Therefore, bottle number 576 is poisoned.\n\n**Why Binary Search Works:** Binary search allows you to test a large number of possibilities quickly. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles simultaneously. \n\n**JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
