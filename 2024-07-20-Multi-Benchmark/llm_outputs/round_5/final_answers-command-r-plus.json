Now, take the binary number associated with that prisoner and divide the bottles in that group into subgroups, again using binary numbers. For example, if the poisoned bottle was in Group 73, you would now create subgroups based on the binary digits of numbers 0 through 73.\n7. Repeat this process with the remaining prisoners, narrowing down the possibilities with each 24-hour period until you've identified the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis strategy guarantees that the poisoned bottle will be found in no more than 10 tests, which is the fastest method given the constraints.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
