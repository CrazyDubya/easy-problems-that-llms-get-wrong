In the Monty Hall problem, you initially choose one of three doors. The host, who knows what is behind each door, then opens one of the other two doors, revealing a rotten vegetable. You are then given the option to stick with your original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Choice**: When you first pick a door, there is a 1\/3 chance that you have chosen the door with the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance that you have chosen a door with rotten vegetables.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host then opens one of the other two doors, revealing a rotten vegetable.

This is because if your initial choice was wrong (which has a 2\/3 probability), switching will always lead you to the gold bar.\n\nTherefore, switching doors gives you a higher probability of winning the gold bar.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the best choice is to switch to Door No. 2.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Since your opponent fired and no bullet came out, we know that the chamber he fired was the one empty chamber.\n\nNow, if you do not spin the chambers again, the revolver will move to the next chamber in sequence. Since there are 5 bullets and 6 chambers, the probability that the next chamber contains a bullet is 5\/5 (or 100%).\n\nIf you spin the chambers again, you reset the probabilities.

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. You know that one guardian always tells the truth and the other always lies.\n2. You also know that the taller guardian always tells the truth and guards the death door.\n\nGiven this setup, you can ask a single question to either guardian to determine the door to freedom. The key is to ask a question that will give you a consistent answer regardless of which guardian you ask.\n\nThe question you can ask is: \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\n- If you ask the truth-telling guardian (who guards the death door), they will truthfully tell you that the lying guardian would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the lying guardian, they will lie about what the truth-telling guardian would say, and thus also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the answer you get will point to the death door. Therefore, you should choose the opposite door to ensure your safety.\n\nThus, the minimum number of questions needed to determine the door to freedom is one.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

However, the problem does not specify that you can observe the bulbs immediately after each switch is toggled.\n\nB. You must walk into another room to observe the bulbs.\n- This option implies that you cannot see the bulbs while toggling the switches. This makes it more challenging to determine which switch controls which bulb without a more systematic approach.\n\nC.

The key insight here is to use a binary representation to leverage the 10 prisoners effectively.\n\nEach prisoner can be thought of as a binary digit (bit) in a 10-bit binary number. With 10 prisoners, we can represent up to \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) different combinations, which is more than enough to cover the 1000 bottles.\n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Number each bottle from 1 to 1000.\n2. Convert each bottle number to its 10-bit binary equivalent.\n3. Assign each prisoner to a specific bit position (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit).\n4. For each bottle, if the bit in the binary representation is 1, the corresponding prisoner will drink from that bottle.\n5. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners are dead. The combination of dead and alive prisoners will form a binary number that corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle with just one round of testing, using the binary representation of the bottle numbers and the 10 prisoners.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
