If no one dies, then the poisoned bottle is in the remaining 900 bottles.\n5. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles and prisoners until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to narrow down the search for the poisoned bottle quickly and efficiently. It also minimizes the number of prisoners who need to drink the poisoned wine, which is important for ethical reasons.\n\nOption B is not a good choice because it would require all of the prisoners to drink from each bottle, which would be time-consuming and potentially dangerous. Option C is not a good choice because it relies on the prisoners' ability to detect the poison, which may not be reliable. Option D is not a good choice because it would require the prisoners to drink a potentially lethal dose of poison, which is unethical.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
