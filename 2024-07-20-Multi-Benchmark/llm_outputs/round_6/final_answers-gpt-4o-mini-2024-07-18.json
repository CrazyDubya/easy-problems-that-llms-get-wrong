If the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 (1\/3 chance), switching to Door No. 2 will result in a loss.

This means there is only 1 empty chamber. When your opponent spins the chambers and fires, the probability of landing on the empty chamber is 1 in 6 (1\/6). Since your opponent fired and the gun did not go off, we know that the chamber that was fired was the empty one.\n\nNow, if you choose to spin the chambers again, the situation resets. You would again have a 1 in 6 chance of landing on the empty chamber, as the bullets are randomly distributed in the chambers.\n\nHowever, if you do not spin again, the revolver is now in a specific state.

This is sufficient to cover all 1000 bottles.\n2. **Testing Strategy**: Each bottle can be assigned a unique binary number from 0000000000 (0) to 1111101000 (999). Each prisoner will drink from the bottles based on the binary representation of the bottle number. For example, if the binary representation of a bottle number has a '1' in the position corresponding to a prisoner, that prisoner will drink from that bottle.\n3. **Results Interpretation**: After 24 hours, the king will observe which prisoners die. The combination of dead prisoners will form a binary number that directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle.

The question asks how many pairs of twins are needed in a room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people share the same birthday.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each pair of twins consists of 2 people. Therefore, if we have \\( n \\) pairs of twins, we have \\( 2n \\) individuals in total.\n\n2. **Calculating the Probability**: The probability that at least two people share a birthday can be calculated using the complement principle. We first calculate the probability that no one shares a birthday and then subtract that from 1.\n\n3. **Using the Birthday Problem Formula**: The probability \\( P \\) that at least two people share a birthday among \\( k \\) people is given by:\n   \\[\n   P = 1 - \\frac{365!}{(365-k)! \\cdot 365^k}\n   \\]\n   where \\( k \\) is the number of people.\n\n4. **Finding the Threshold**: We want to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( P \\geq 0.5 \\).

Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"To find out how fast I need to run back to double my average speed for the entire trip, we first need to calculate the average speed for the round trip.\n\n1. **Calculate the total distance and time for the trip:**\n   - Let the distance to my friend's house be \\( d \\).\n   - The time taken to walk to my friend's house at 3 mph is \\( \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n   - Let \\( r \\) be the speed at which I run back. The time taken to run back is \\( \\frac{d}{r} \\) hours.\n   - The total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\).\n   - The total time for the round trip is \\( \\frac{d}{3} + \\frac{d}{r} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the average speed for the entire trip:**\n   - The average speed \\( V_{avg} \\) for the entire trip is given by:\n     \\[\n     V_{avg} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{3} + \\frac{d}{r}}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying this, we get:\n     \\[\n     V_{avg} = \\frac{2d}{d \\left( \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{r} \\right)} = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{r}}\n     \\]\n   - This can be further simplified to:\n     \\[\n     V_{avg} = \\frac{2r}{\\frac{r}{3} + 1}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Set the average speed to double the walking speed:**\n   - I want to double my average speed, which means:\n     \\[\n     V_{avg} = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ mph}\n     \\]\n   - Setting the equation equal to 6 mph:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2r}{\\frac{r}{3} + 1} = 6\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( r \\):**\n   - Cross-multiplying gives:\n     \\[\n     2r = 6 \\left( \\frac{r}{3} + 1 \\right)\n     \\]\n   - Expanding the right side:\n     \\[\n     2r = 2r + 6\n     \\]\n   - This simplifies to:\n     \\[\n     0 = 6\n     \\]\n   - This indicates that there is no finite speed \\( r \\) that can achieve this, meaning I would need to run infinitely fast to double my average speed.\n\nThus, the answer is C. Infinitely fast.\n\nReturning the answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""}}
