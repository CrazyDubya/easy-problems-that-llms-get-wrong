When you first choose Door No. 1, there is a 1\/3 chance that the gold bar is behind that door and a 2\/3 chance that it is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3).\n2. The host then reveals that Door No. 3 has rotten vegetables (which he can do because he knows where the gold bar is).\n3.

This means there is only 1 empty chamber. When your opponent spins the chambers and fires, the probability of landing on the empty chamber is 1 in 6 (1\/6). Since your opponent fired and the gun did not go off, we know that the chamber that was fired was the empty one.\n\nNow, if you choose to spin the chambers again, the situation resets. You would again have a 1 in 6 chance of landing on the empty chamber, as the bullets are randomly distributed in the chambers.\n\nHowever, if you do not spin again, you know that the next chamber in line (after the empty one that was just fired) must be one of the 5 loaded chambers. Therefore, if you do not spin, you are guaranteed to hit a bullet on your turn.\n\nIn conclusion, if you do not spin, you will definitely lose, as the next chamber will contain a bullet. If you spin again, you have a 1 in 6 chance of survival. Therefore, it is better to spin the chambers again.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the best choice is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Each prisoner can represent a binary digit (bit), allowing us to test multiple bottles simultaneously.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: With 10 prisoners, we can represent numbers from 0 to 1023 (2^10 - 1). This means we can uniquely identify each of the 1000 bottles using a 10-bit binary number.\n\n2. **Testing Strategy**: Each bottle can be assigned a unique binary number from 0000000000 (for bottle 1) to 1111101000 (for bottle 1000). Each prisoner will drink from the bottles based on the binary representation of the bottle number:\n   - If the i-th bit of the bottle's number is 1, the i-th prisoner will drink from that bottle.\n   - If the i-th bit is 0, the i-th prisoner will not drink from that bottle.\n\n3. **Results Interpretation**: After 24 hours, the king will observe which prisoners are affected (i.e., which ones die). The combination of prisoners that die will form a binary number, which can be converted back to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method is efficient and allows the king to determine the poisoned bottle with the minimum number of tests, leveraging the binary system.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

Each pair of twins consists of two people, and since they are twins, they share the same birthday. Therefore, for every pair of twins, we can consider that they contribute to the probability of having at least one shared birthday.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: \n   - Each pair of twins contributes two people to the room.\n   - If we have 1 pair of twins, there are 2 people, and they will definitely share a birthday.\n   - For 23 pairs of twins, there are 46 people, and we need to calculate the probability that at least two of these 46 people share a birthday.\n\n2. **Calculating the Probability**:\n   - The classic birthday problem states that with 23 people, there is about a 50% chance that at least two people share a birthday. \n   - Since each pair of twins counts as two people, we can directly apply this to the number of pairs.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since 1 pair of twins guarantees a shared birthday, the answer must be at least 1 pair.\n   - However, to reach the threshold of 50% probability for a larger group, we refer back to the classic birthday problem, which indicates that 23 individuals (or 11.5 pairs) are needed to reach that probability. Since we can only have whole pairs, we round up to 12 pairs.\n\nThus, the answer to the question is that you need **12 pairs of twins** in a room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n\nThe final answer in JSON format is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Instead, they can jump slightly higher than the height of the hurdle to clear it. However, if they are simply stepping over it without a significant jump, they could potentially clear the hurdle with a jump that is just slightly above the height of the hurdle.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the minimum height he could have jumped would be slightly higher than 0.5m to ensure he clears the hurdle safely. Therefore, the best answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"30":{"category":"Popular science","question":"I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.
