This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles of wine into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from the bottles in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoner dies.\n4. Once the prisoner who drank from the poisoned bottle is identified, divide the remaining 900 bottles into 9 groups of 100 bottles each.\n5. Assign each group to the remaining 9 prisoners and have them drink from the bottles in their group.\n6. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoner dies.\n7. Repeat this process until only one bottle remains.\n\nThis strategy ensures that the king will be able to identify the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time possible, while minimizing the number of prisoners who need to be sacrificed. Option A would require all 10 prisoners to drink from the poisoned bottle, while option B would require each prisoner to drink from all 1000 bottles. Option C is not feasible since the poison is tasteless.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
