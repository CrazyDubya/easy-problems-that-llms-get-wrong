Option B is not feasible, as it would require each prisoner to test all 1000 bottles of wine, which is impractical.

This is a classic problem of birthday probability.\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n\nFor a single person, the probability of having a birthday on any given day is 1\/365.\n\nFor two people, the probability that they have different birthdays is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) = 364\/365, since the second person can't have the same birthday as the first. The probability that they have the same birthday is therefore 1 - 364\/365 = 1\/365.\n\nNow, let's consider a room with n pairs of twins. We want to find the smallest n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%.\n\nUsing the complementary probability, we can calculate the probability that all n pairs of twins have different birthdays. This is equivalent to the probability that no two people share a birthday.\n\nFor n pairs of twins, the probability that all birthdays are different is:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n)\/365)\n\nWe want to find the smallest n such that this probability is less than or equal to 0.5.\n\nAfter calculating the probabilities for different values of n, we find that:\n\n* For n = 12 pairs, the probability of all birthdays being different is approximately 0.507\n* For n = 23 pairs, the probability of all birthdays being different is approximately 0.493\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
