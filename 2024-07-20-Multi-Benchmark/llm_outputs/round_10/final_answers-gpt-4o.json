In the Monty Hall problem, you initially choose one of three doors. The host, who knows what is behind each door, then opens one of the other two doors, revealing a rotten vegetable. You are then given the option to stick with your original choice or switch to the remaining unopened door.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Choice**: When you first pick a door, there is a 1\/3 chance that you have chosen the door with the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance that you have chosen a door with rotten vegetables.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host then opens one of the other two doors, revealing a rotten vegetable. This action does not change the initial probabilities but provides additional information.\n\n3. **Switching vs. Staying**:\n   - If you stick with your initial choice (Door No. 1), your probability of winning remains 1\/3.\n   - If you switch to the other unopened door (Door No. 2 in this case), your probability of winning increases to 2\/3. This is because if your initial choice was wrong (which has a 2\/3 probability), switching will always lead you to the gold bar.\n\nTherefore, switching doors gives you a higher probability of winning the gold bar.\n\nGiven the options:\n- A.

The key insight here is to use the 10 prisoners in a way that maximizes the information we can gather from their survival or death.\n\nBy leveraging the concept of binary numbers, we can assign each bottle a unique binary code from 0000000000 to 1111101000 (which corresponds to the decimal numbers 0 to 999). Each of the 10 prisoners will represent a bit in the binary code. \n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Label each bottle with a number from 0 to 999.\n2. Convert each number to its 10-bit binary equivalent.\n3. Assign each bit position to a specific prisoner. For example, the first prisoner will represent the least significant bit (2^0), the second prisoner will represent the next bit (2^1), and so on up to the tenth prisoner who will represent the most significant bit (2^9).\n4. For each bottle, if a bit in its binary representation is 1, the corresponding prisoner will take a sip from that bottle. If the bit is 0, the prisoner will not sip from that bottle.\n5. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners have died. The combination of dead and alive prisoners will form a binary number that directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that we can uniquely identify any one of the 1000 bottles using just 10 prisoners.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

You ask each current guest to move to the room number n*2.\n   - This would move each guest to an even-numbered room, effectively freeing up all the odd-numbered rooms.
