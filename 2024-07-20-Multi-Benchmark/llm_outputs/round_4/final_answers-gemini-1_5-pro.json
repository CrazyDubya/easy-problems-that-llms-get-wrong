They are essentially concentrating the probability of the unopened door you didn't initially choose.\n\n3. **Switching's Power:**  When you switch to Door No. 2, you're essentially taking advantage of the concentrated 2\/3 probability that the gold bar was initially behind one of the doors you *didn't* pick. \n\n**In simpler terms:**  Imagine there were 100 doors.

The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\nANSWERS\nA. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD.

Here's why: \\n\\n* **Binary Search:**  Imagine numbering the bottles 1 to 1000.  \\n    * **Day 1:** Each prisoner is assigned a specific binary place value (1, 2, 4, 8,... up to 512).  \\n    * Each prisoner drinks from bottles where their assigned place value has a '1' in the bottle's binary representation. (e.g., Prisoner '4' drinks from bottles 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15... and so on). \\n    * **Day 2:** Observe which prisoners die. Their death pattern represents the binary code of the poisoned bottle. For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 8 die, the poisoned bottle is number 13 (1 + 4 + 8 = 13, or 0000001101 in binary). \\n\\n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\\n    * **A:**  This is unnecessarily cruel and only tests 10 bottles at a time. \\n    * **C:**  This is logistically impossible and dangerous, exposing prisoners to far too much poison. \\n    * **D:** The question states the poison is only noticeable after 24 hours, making this method ineffective.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
