Assign each bottle a unique 10-digit binary number. Have each prisoner sample the bottles corresponding to their assigned digit (e.g. prisoner 1 samples bottles ending in 1, prisoner 2 samples bottles ending in 2, etc.). After 24 hours, the prisoners still alive will reveal the binary encoding of the poisoned bottle. This allows testing 1024 bottles with 10 prisoners in just 24 hours.\n\nC. Having all prisoners sample all 1000 bottles would result in all the prisoners likely dying, and would not reveal which specific bottle was poisoned.\n\nD. The question states the poison is very bitter, but having prisoners taste for bitterness is unreliable and subjective. It's safer to wait for the poison to take effect. Also, sampling all 1000 bottles would take a very long time.\n\nTherefore, the binary search strategy in B is the fastest and most reliable way to identify the single poisoned bottle out of 1000 in 24 hours using 10 prisoners.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

If the trolley continues on its current path, it will hit and likely kill those five people. By pulling the lever, you are actively choosing to save their lives.\n\nNot pulling the lever means letting the trolley continue on its deadly course, which will result in the deaths of the five people.

But most ethical frameworks prioritize minimizing overall harm and saving the most lives possible. Saving five lives at the cost of one is generally seen as the right action.\n\nIn summary, I believe pulling the lever is the most ethical choice as it saves the greatest number of lives.
