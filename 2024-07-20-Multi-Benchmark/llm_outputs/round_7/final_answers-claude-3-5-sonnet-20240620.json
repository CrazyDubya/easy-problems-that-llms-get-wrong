We can achieve this by racing the 4th place horse from the first race with the 2nd and 3rd place horses from the bottom group.\n\n7. This gives us a total of three races:\n   - Race 1: All six horses\n   - Race 2: Bottom three horses from Race 1\n   - Race 3: 4th place from Race 1 and top two from Race 2\n\n8.

If you don't spin again, you know for certain that the next chamber (which will rotate into firing position) contains a bullet. This gives you a 100% chance of firing a bullet.\n\n4. If you do spin again, you're essentially resetting the odds. There are now 5 bullets in 5 chambers (since we know one chamber is empty). This gives you a 5\/6 chance of firing a bullet.\n\n5.

We know that one guardian always tells the truth and the other always lies.\n2. We also know that the truthful guardian is guarding the death door.\n3. We don't need to know which guardian is which, we just need to find the door to freedom.\n\nThe key is to ask a question that will give us the same result regardless of which guardian we ask. Here's a question that would work:\n\n\"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\nLet's break down why this works:\n\n- If you ask the truthful guardian, they will truthfully tell you what the lying guardian would say. The lying guardian would point to the death door, so the truthful guardian would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the lying guardian, they will lie about what the truthful guardian would say. The truthful guardian would point to the death door, but the lying guardian would say they'd point to the freedom door.\n\nIn both cases, the guardian you ask will point to the death door. Therefore, you know the other door is the one that leads to freedom.\n\nThis can be solved with just one question, so the answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.
