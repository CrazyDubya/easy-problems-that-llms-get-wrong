Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\nProvide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"C\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is C and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:**  The king needs to find *one* poisoned bottle out of 1000, and he only has time for one round of testing (since the poison takes 24 hours to work).\n\n* **Why A, B, and D are incorrect:**\n    * **A & B:**  These methods would kill all the prisoners and are incredibly inefficient.\n    * **D:**  The poison is stated to be tasteless, only taking effect after 24 hours.\n\n* **Why C is correct (Binary Search):**\n\n1. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n\n2. **Number the Bottles:**  Imagine each bottle of wine is assigned a number from 1 to 1000. Convert these numbers to their binary equivalent (e.g., bottle 1 is 0000000001, bottle 2 is 0000000010, bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.). Since the highest number is 1000 (which needs 10 digits in binary), make sure each bottle's binary representation has 10 digits.\n\n3. **Assign Wine Based on Binary:** Each prisoner will drink from bottles based on their corresponding binary digit.  For example:\n    * Prisoner 1 (representing the ones place in binary): Drinks from every bottle where the bottle's binary representation ends in a 1.\n    * Prisoner 2 (representing the twos place in binary): Drinks from every bottle where the bottle's binary representation has a 1 in the second-to-last digit. \n    * ...and so on.\n\n4. **Observe After 24 Hours:**  Note which prisoners die.  If Prisoner 1 dies, it means the poisoned bottle's binary representation has a 1 in the ones place. If Prisoner 2 dies, the binary representation has a 1 in the twos place, and so on.\n\n5. **Construct the Binary Code:**  Create a binary number based on which prisoners died. For example, if Prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number would be 0010100001.\n\n6. **Convert to Decimal:** Convert the resulting binary number back to decimal. This decimal number is the poisoned bottle. In our example (0010100001), this would be bottle number 577.\n\n**In essence, the king is using the prisoners as living binary bits to pinpoint the poisoned bottle in a single test.**\" \n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

The surprising fact is that you need far fewer people than you might think to have a high probability of a shared birthday.  Here's why:\n\n* **Focus on Differences:** Instead of calculating the probability that two people share a birthday, it's easier to calculate the probability that they *don't* share a birthday.\n* **First Pair:** The first twin in a pair can have any birthday. The second twin has a 1\/365 chance of having the same birthday (ignoring leap years for simplicity). That means there's a 364\/365 chance they have different birthdays.\n* **Subsequent Pairs:**  With each additional pair of twins, you continue to multiply the probability of 'no shared birthday yet' by the decreasing chance of a new, unique birthday. \n* **Reaching 50%:** You need to keep adding pairs of twins and multiplying these probabilities until the overall probability dips below 50%. \n\nWhile you don't need to do the full calculation here, the birthday paradox tells us that with around 23 people in a room, there's already a greater than 50% chance of a shared birthday. Since we're dealing with twins who share birthdays, 23 pairs of twins will guarantee that probability.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
