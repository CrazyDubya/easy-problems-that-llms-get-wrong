Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"Here is my analysis of the question and answer choices:\n\nThe key constraints are:\n- There are 1000 bottles of wine, one of which is poisoned\n- The poison takes effect in exactly 24 hours\n- There are only 10 prisoners available to test the wine\n- The poisoned bottle needs to be identified within 24 hours\n\nChoice A is not feasible because having the prisoners sample all 1000 bottles would likely kill all of them. \n\nChoice B is better than A by dividing the bottles among the prisoners, but there's still a high chance multiple prisoners would die. It also doesn't guarantee the exact bottle is identified.\n\nChoice D relies on taste to identify the poison, but the question states the wine is sweet while only the poison is bitter. Tasting alone is not reliable enough.\n\nChoice C is the best answer. Using a binary search strategy, the bottles can be divided into groups and subgroups, with a different combination of prisoners sampling from each subgroup. Mapping this to binary numbers, with 10 prisoners you can uniquely identify 2^10 = 1024 different bottles, which covers the 1000 bottles in the problem. This will conclusively identify the exact poisoned bottle within 24 hours with no prisoners dying.\n\nSo in summary:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n\nThe binary search approach is the most efficient and reliable way to solve this challenging problem within the constraints given.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

So pulling the lever has a direct positive impact on the lives of those five individuals by saving them from being killed by the oncoming trolley.\n\nHowever, the question does not specify if there are any people on the other track that the trolley would be diverted to.
