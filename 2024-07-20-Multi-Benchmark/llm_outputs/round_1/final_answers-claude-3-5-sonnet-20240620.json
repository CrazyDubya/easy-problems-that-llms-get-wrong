The optimal question to ask is: \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\n4.

Simply dividing the bottles among prisoners (option B) would work, but it's not the most efficient method.\n\n4. The key to solving this puzzle efficiently is to use the binary system (option C). Here's how it works:\n\n   - With 10 prisoners, we can represent 2^10 = 1024 different combinations, which covers our 1000 bottles.\n   - Assign each bottle a unique 10-digit binary number (000 to 999 in binary).\n   - Each prisoner represents a digit in this binary number.\n   - If a prisoner's digit is 1, they drink from that bottle; if 0, they don't.\n   - After 24 hours, the king can determine the poisoned bottle by looking at which prisoners died.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 7 die, the poisoned bottle would be 1010001000 in binary (640 in decimal).\n\nThis method is the fastest because it uses all available information from the 10 prisoners in a single 24-hour period, allowing the king to pinpoint the exact bottle.\n\nTherefore, the most efficient solution is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.
