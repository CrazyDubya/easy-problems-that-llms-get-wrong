This is a classic problem known as the \"birthday problem.\"\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n\nFor a single pair of twins, the probability that they share a birthday is 1, since they're twins.\n\nFor two pairs of twins, the probability that at least one pair shares a birthday is still 1, since each pair is guaranteed to share a birthday.\n\nHowever, as we add more pairs of twins, the probability that at least two people share a birthday starts to increase. We can calculate this probability using the complementary probability, i.e., the probability that no two people share a birthday.\n\nFor 2n people (n pairs of twins), the probability that no two people share a birthday is:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365)\n\nThis is because the first person can have any birthday, the second person can have any birthday except the first person's, the third person can have any birthday except the first two, and so on.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the probability that at least two people share a birthday as:\n\n1 - (probability that no two people share a birthday)\n\nAfter calculating this probability for different values of n, we find that when n = 23 (i.e., 46 people), the probability that at least two people share a birthday exceeds 50%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
