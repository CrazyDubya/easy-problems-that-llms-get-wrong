This is a classic problem known as the \"birthday problem.\"\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n\nFor a single pair of twins, the probability that they share a birthday is 1, since they're twins.\n\nFor two pairs of twins, the probability that at least one pair shares a birthday is still 1, since each pair is guaranteed to share a birthday.\n\nHowever, as we add more pairs of twins, the probability that at least two people share a birthday starts to increase. We can calculate this probability using the complementary probability, i.e., the probability that no two people share a birthday.\n\nFor 2n people (n pairs of twins), the probability that no two people share a birthday is:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365)\n\nThis is because the first person can have any birthday, the second person can have any birthday except the first person's, the third person can have any birthday except the first two, and so on.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the probability that at least two people share a birthday as:\n\n1 - (probability that no two people share a birthday)\n\nAfter calculating this probability for different values of n, we find that when n = 23 (i.e., 46 people), the probability that at least two people share a birthday exceeds 50%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"24":{"level_0":24,"index":25,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Then, the time it takes me to run back is t - (t\/2) = t\/2.\n\nSince the distance is the same, we can set up the equation:\n\nDistance \/ 3mph = t\nDistance \/ x mph = t\/2\n\nwhere x is the speed at which I need to run back.\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 6mph\n\nSo, I need to run back at 6mph to double my average speed for the entire trip.\n\nHere's my answer in JSON format:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"60":{"level_0":60,"index":1,"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have six horses and want to race them to see which is fastest.

Option A is not feasible because the poison takes effect in 24 hours, so the prisoners won't be able to taste the bitterness immediately. Option B is also not practical because it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is not possible in 24 hours.\n\nOption D is also not the most efficient approach because it would require dividing the 1000 bottles among the 10 prisoners, which means each prisoner would have to test around 100 bottles. This would still take a significant amount of time and might not yield a conclusive result in 24 hours.\n\nThe correct answer is Option C, which uses a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle of wine with a binary number from 1 to 1000 (e.g., 0000000001 to 1111101000).\n2. Divide the 10 prisoners into two groups of 5.\n3. For each group, have them drink a mixture of wine from bottles with a 0 in a specific binary position (e.g., the first group drinks a mixture of wine from bottles with a 0 in the first binary position, and the second group drinks a mixture of wine from bottles with a 0 in the second binary position).\n4. Wait 24 hours and observe which prisoners die.\n5. Based on the results, eliminate half of the bottles from consideration (e.g., if the first group dies, eliminate all bottles with a 1 in the first binary position).\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until only one bottle remains.\n\nThis approach allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just 24 hours using only 10 prisoners.\n\nHere's the answer in JSON format:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"77":{"level_0":77,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

This is because there are more opportunities for birthdays to overlap.\n\nUsing the formula for the birthday problem, we can calculate the probability that at least two people share a birthday as:\n\nP(at least two share a birthday) = 1 - P(no one shares a birthday)\n\nwhere P(no one shares a birthday) is the probability that all pairs of twins have distinct birthdays.\n\nAfter some calculations, we find that with 23 pairs of twins (46 people), the probability that at least two people share a birthday is approximately 50.7%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"84":{"level_0":84,"index":25,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Let's call the time it takes me to walk to my friend's house \"t\". Then, the time it takes me to run back is t - t = t\/2.\n5. Since the distance is the same, the speed I need to run back is twice the distance divided by half the time: 2d \/ (t\/2) = 4d \/ t.\n6. We know that the speed I walk to my friend's house is 3mph, so the time it takes me to walk to my friend's house is t = d \/ 3.\n7. Substituting this into the equation for the speed I need to run back, we get: 4d \/ (d\/3) = 4*3 = 12mph.\n\nSo, I need to run back at 12mph to double my average speed for the entire trip.\n\nHere's the answer in JSON format:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"90":{"level_0":90,"index":1,"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have six horses and want to race them to see which is fastest.

For two people, the probability that they don't share a birthday is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) = 364\/365, since the second person can't have the same birthday as the first person. For three people, the probability that they don't share a birthday is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) = 364\/365 \u00d7 363\/365.\n\nAs we add more people to the room, the probability that they don't share a birthday decreases. We want to find the smallest number of people (or pairs of twins) such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is greater than or equal to 50%.\n\nUsing the formula for the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday, we can calculate that with 23 pairs of twins (46 people), the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is approximately 50.7%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"114":{"level_0":114,"index":25,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Since there's only one torch, we need to pair people up to cross the bridge together. The key insight is that the slower person in each pair determines the time it takes for that pair to cross.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. A and B cross together (2 minutes), then A returns with the torch (1 minute), then C and D cross together (10 minutes). Total time: 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 minutes.\n2. A and C cross together (5 minutes), then A returns with the torch (1 minute), then B and D cross together (10 minutes). Total time: 5 + 1 + 10 = 16 minutes.\n3. A and D cross together (10 minutes), then A returns with the torch (1 minute), then B and C cross together (5 minutes). Total time: 10 + 1 + 5 = 16 minutes.\n\nHowever, we can do better. What if A crosses with B, then returns with the torch, then crosses with C, then returns with the torch, and finally D crosses alone? This would take: 2 minutes (A and B), 1 minute (A returns), 5 minutes (A and C), 1 minute (A returns), and 10 minutes (D crosses alone). Total time: 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 10 = 19 minutes.\n\nBut wait, we can optimize this further! What if A crosses with B, then B returns with the torch, then A crosses with C, then C returns with the torch, and finally D crosses alone? This would take: 2 minutes (A and B), 2 minutes (B returns), 5 minutes (A and C), 5 minutes (C returns), and 10 minutes (D crosses alone). Total time: 2 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 10 = 24 minutes.\n\nHowever, this is not the fastest time. Let's try again. What if A crosses with B, then A returns with the torch, then C crosses with D, then A returns with the torch, and finally A crosses alone? This would take: 2 minutes (A and B), 1 minute (A returns), 10 minutes (C and D), 1 minute (A returns), and 1 minute (A crosses alone). Total time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 15 minutes.\n\nThis is still not the fastest time. Let's try again. What if A crosses alone, then returns with the torch, then B crosses with C, then A returns with the torch, and finally D crosses alone?

Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"Here's my explanation and answer:\n\nThe key to this problem is to use the prisoners efficiently to test the wine and minimize the number of tests needed. Option A is not feasible because the poison takes effect 24 hours after consumption, so the prisoners won't be able to taste the bitterness immediately. Option C is also not viable because it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is impractical and would likely result in many deaths.\n\nOption D is close, but it's not the most efficient approach. If we divide the bottles among the 10 prisoners, each prisoner would have to test around 100 bottles, and we would still need to wait 24 hours to see who dies.\n\nThe correct answer is Option B, which uses a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a binary number from 1 to 1000 (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 512, 1024).\n2. Divide the 10 prisoners into two groups of 5.\n3. Have each prisoner in the first group drink a mixture of wine from bottles with a \"1\" in the first binary digit (e.g., bottles 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...).\n4. Have each prisoner in the second group drink a mixture of wine from bottles with a \"1\" in the second binary digit (e.g., bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, ...).\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 for each of the 10 binary digits.\n6. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners die and which survive.\n7. Use the binary digits to determine which bottle is poisoned.\n\nFor example, if prisoners in the first group who drank mixtures with a \"1\" in the first binary digit die, and prisoners in the second group who drank mixtures with a \"1\" in the second binary digit survive, then the poisoned bottle is likely to be one of the bottles with a \"1\" in the first binary digit and a \"0\" in the second binary digit (e.g., bottle 1, 5, 9, ...). By repeating this process for each binary digit, the king can narrow down the possibilities to a single bottle.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it uses the 10 prisoners to test multiple bottles simultaneously, and the binary search strategy reduces the number of tests needed to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"137":{"level_0":137,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nWrite a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\nANSWERS\nA.

We want to find the smallest value of n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%.\n\nWe can approach this problem by calculating the probability of the opposite event: that no two people share a birthday.

The probability that the second person has a unique birthday (different from the first person) is 364\/365, since one birthday is already taken. The probability that the third person has a unique birthday (different from the first two) is 363\/365, and so on.\n\nFor 2n people, the probability that all of them have unique birthdays is:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-2n+1)\/365)\n\nWe want to find the smallest value of n such that this probability is less than or equal to 50%.

This creates a moral conflict, as we're forced to weigh the value of one life against the lives of five others.\n\nWith this in mind, I choose:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that this problem is often framed as an ethical dilemma (Option A), as it challenges our moral intuitions and forces us to consider the consequences of our actions.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"146":{"level_0":146,"index":27,"category":"Puzzle","question":"How do you efficiently measure exactly 4 gallons of water with only a 3-gallon, 5-gallon, 4-gallon, and 2-gallon jug?","human_answer":"Fill up the 4-gallon jug","correct_answer":"Another option not stated.","multiple_choice":["Filling the 5-gallon jug and pouring it into the 3-gallon jug, twice.","Filling the 5-gallon jug and pouring it into the 4-gallon jug.","Filling the 2-gallon jug, twice.","Another option not stated."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\nHow do you efficiently measure exactly 4 gallons of water with only a 3-gallon, 5-gallon, 4-gallon, and 2-gallon jug?\n\nANSWERS\nA.

Option B is not feasible as it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is impractical.

This is known as the \"birthday problem.\"\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n\nFor a single pair of twins, the probability that they share a birthday is 1, since they're twins.\n\nFor two pairs of twins, the probability that at least one pair shares a birthday is still 1, since each pair is guaranteed to share a birthday.\n\nHowever, as we add more pairs of twins, the probability that at least two people share a birthday starts to increase. This is because there are more opportunities for birthdays to overlap.\n\nUsing the formula for the birthday problem, we can calculate the probability that at least two people share a birthday as:\n\nP(at least two share a birthday) = 1 - P(no one shares a birthday)\n\nwhere P(no one shares a birthday) is the probability that all pairs of twins have distinct birthdays.\n\nAfter some calculations, we find that with 23 pairs of twins (46 people), the probability that at least two people share a birthday is approximately 50.7%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"174":{"level_0":174,"index":25,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

This is a thought-provoking ethical dilemma that has sparked debates among philosophers and ethicists. In this scenario, pulling the lever would divert the trolley to the alternative track, but it's implied that there's a single person on that track who would be killed as a result. The question is, is it morally justifiable to sacrifice one person to save the lives of five others?\n\nIn this case, pulling the lever would not directly impact the lives of the five people on the original track, as they would be spared from the trolley's path.

I walk to my friend's house at 3mph. This means the time it takes to walk to my friend's house is the distance divided by 3mph.\n2. To double my average speed for the entire trip, I need to make the total time for the round trip (walking to my friend's house and running back) equal to half the time it takes to walk to my friend's house.\n3. Since the distance to my friend's house is the same as the distance back, the time it takes to run back must be equal to the time it takes to walk to my friend's house.\n4. Let's call the time it takes to walk to my friend's house \"t\". Then, the time it takes to run back is also \"t\".\n5. The total time for the round trip is 2t. To double my average speed, the total time must be half the time it takes to walk to my friend's house, which is t\/2.\n6. Since the total time is 2t, we set up the equation: 2t = t\/2.\n7.

Since there's only one torch, two people must cross at a time. We can pair them up in different ways to find the optimal solution.\n\nLet's analyze the possible pairings:\n\n1. A and B: A takes 1 minute, B takes 2 minutes, so the total time for this pair is 2 minutes. A returns with the torch (1 minute), and then C and D cross together.\n2. A and C: A takes 1 minute, C takes 5 minutes, so the total time for this pair is 5 minutes. A returns with the torch (1 minute), and then B and D cross together.\n3. A and D: A takes 1 minute, D takes 10 minutes, so the total time for this pair is 10 minutes. A returns with the torch (1 minute), and then B and C cross together.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total time for each scenario:\n\n1. A and B: 2 minutes (A and B) + 1 minute (A returns) + 10 minutes (C and D) = 13 minutes\n2. A and C: 5 minutes (A and C) + 1 minute (A returns) + 2 minutes (B and D) = 8 minutes\n3. A and D: 10 minutes (A and D) + 1 minute (A returns) + 5 minutes (B and C) = 16 minutes\n\nThe fastest time is 8 minutes, but wait! We can do better. In scenario 2, when A returns with the torch, B can cross immediately, taking 2 minutes. Then, D can cross, taking 10 minutes.

Option A is not feasible because the poison takes effect 24 hours after consumption, so the prisoners won't be able to taste the bitterness immediately. Option D is also not practical because it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is not possible in 24 hours.\n\nOption C is closer to the correct solution, but it's still not the most efficient approach. If we divide the bottles among the prisoners, we would need to wait 24 hours to see which prisoner dies, and then we would still have a large number of bottles to test.\n\nThe correct answer is Option B, which uses a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a binary number from 0 to 999 (using 10 binary digits).\n2. Assign each prisoner a unique binary number from 0 to 9.\n3. For each bottle, if the i-th binary digit is 1, the prisoner with the corresponding binary number drinks from that bottle.\n4. Wait 24 hours and observe which prisoners die.\n5. Use the binary numbers of the dead prisoners to determine the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis approach allows us to identify the poisoned bottle in a single round of testing, using all 10 prisoners efficiently.

I walk to my friend's house at 3mph. This means the time it takes to walk to my friend's house is the distance divided by 3mph.\n2. To double my average speed for the entire trip, I need to make the total time for the round trip (walking to my friend's house and running back) equal to half the time it takes to walk to my friend's house.\n3. Since the distance to my friend's house is the same as the distance back, the time it takes to run back must be equal to the time it takes to walk to my friend's house.\n4. Let's call the time it takes to walk to my friend's house \"t\". Then, the time it takes to run back is also \"t\".\n5. The total time for the round trip is 2t. To double my average speed, the total time must be half the time it takes to walk to my friend's house, which is t\/2.\n6. Since the total time is 2t, we set up the equation: 2t = t\/2.\n7.

Then, the time it takes to run back is the distance divided by v.

A and B: A takes 1 minute, B takes 2 minutes, so the total time for this pair is 2 minutes. A returns with the torch (1 minute), and then C and D cross together.\n2.

The probability that they have the same birthday as at least one of the previous people is therefore 1 - (365 - number of people)\/365.\n\nUsing this logic, we can calculate the probability that at least two people share a birthday for different numbers of people in the room:\n\n* 2 people: 1\/365\n* 3 people: 1 - (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u2248 0.082\n* 4 people: 1 - (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 (362\/365) \u2248 0.163\n* ...\n* 23 people: 1 - (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 (343\/365) \u2248 0.507\n\nAs we can see, with 23 people in the room, the probability that at least two people share a birthday is greater than 50%.\n\nSince we're asked to find the number of pairs of twins, we need to divide the total number of people by 2.

I walk to my friend's house at 3mph. This means the time it takes to walk to my friend's house is the distance divided by 3mph.\n2. To double my average speed for the entire trip, I need to make the total time for the round trip (walking to my friend's house and running back) equal to half the time it takes to walk to my friend's house.\n3. Since the distance to my friend's house is the same as the distance back, the time it takes to run back must be equal to the time it takes to walk to my friend's house.\n4. Let's call the time it takes to walk to my friend's house \"t\". Then, the time it takes to run back is also \"t\".\n5. The total time for the round trip is 2t. To double my average speed, the total time must be half the time it takes to walk to my friend's house, which is t\/2.\n6. Since the total time is 2t, we set up the equation: 2t = t\/2.\n7. To solve for the running speed, we can use the formula: running speed = distance \/ time. We know the distance is the same as the distance to my friend's house, and the time is t.\n8.

Since there's only one torch, we need to pair people up to cross the bridge together. The optimal strategy is to pair the fastest person with the slowest person, and the second-fastest person with the second-slowest person.\n\nHere's one possible sequence:\n\n1. A and D cross together (10 minutes, since D is the slowest)\n2. A returns with the torch (1 minute)\n3. B and C cross together (5 minutes, since C is the second-slowest)\n4. B returns with the torch (2 minutes)\n5. A crosses again (1 minute)\n\nThe total time is: 10 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 19 minutes. However, we can optimize this further by noticing that when B returns with the torch, A can immediately cross again, so steps 4 and 5 can be combined.\n\nThe corrected sequence is:\n\n1. A and D cross together (10 minutes)\n2. A returns with the torch (1 minute)\n3. B and C cross together (5 minutes)\n4.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"Here's my explanation and answer:\n\nThe key to this problem is to realize that we're not looking for the probability that two specific people have the same birthday, but rather that at least two people out of the total number of people in the room share a birthday.\n\nLet's assume that the birthdays are evenly distributed across the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n\nWhen there's only one pair of twins (2 people), the probability that they share a birthday is 1, since they're twins. However, when we add more people to the room, the probability that at least two people share a birthday increases.\n\nWith 23 people in the room (not 23 pairs of twins), the probability that at least two people share a birthday is greater than 50%. This is because there are 23 people, and each person can have one of 365 possible birthdays. As the number of people increases, the number of possible birthday combinations grows exponentially, making it more likely that at least two people share a birthday.\n\nSo, to answer the question, we don't need 23 pairs of twins, but rather just 23 people in the room. Since each pair of twins consists of 2 people, we would need 23\/2 = 11.5 pairs of twins.

At first glance, it appears to be a simple problem of finding an empty room to accommodate the new guest. However, the phrase \"infinite number of fully furnished rooms\" is a hint that there's more to it.\n\nIf we assume that the hotel is partially full, it means that there are already some guests occupying some of the rooms. The key to solving this problem is to realize that the hotel has an infinite number of rooms, which means that there are always more rooms available, no matter how many guests are already there.\n\nNow, let's analyze the answer options:\n\nA. Asking each current guest to move to the room number n*2 would indeed free up the odd-numbered rooms, but it's not necessary to do so. We don't need to disturb the existing guests to accommodate the new one.\n\nB. This option is incorrect because, as we've established, there are always more rooms available in an infinite hotel.\n\nC. This is the correct answer. Since there are an infinite number of rooms, there must be at least one empty room available to accommodate the new guest.\n\nD.

Since there's only one torch, two people must cross at a time. We can pair them up in different ways to find the optimal solution.\n\nLet's analyze the possible pairings:\n\n1. A and B: A takes 1 minute, B takes 2 minutes, so the total time for this pair is 2 minutes. A returns with the torch (1 minute), and then C and D cross together.\n2. A and C: A takes 1 minute, C takes 5 minutes, so the total time for this pair is 5 minutes. A returns with the torch (1 minute), and then B and D cross together.\n3. A and D: A takes 1 minute, D takes 10 minutes, so the total time for this pair is 10 minutes. A returns with the torch (1 minute), and then B and C cross together.\n\nIn all cases, the second pair to cross will take the maximum time of the two individuals. To minimize the total time, we should pair the fastest person (A) with the slowest person (D) first. This takes 10 minutes.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"Here's my explanation and answer:\n\nThe key to this problem is to realize that we're not looking for the probability that two specific people have the same birthday, but rather that at least two people in the room share a birthday. This is a classic problem of birthday probability.\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n\nFor a single person, the probability of having a birthday on any given day is 1\/365.\n\nFor two people, the probability that they have different birthdays is (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) = 364\/365, since the second person can't have the same birthday as the first. The probability that they have the same birthday is therefore 1 - 364\/365 = 1\/365.\n\nNow, let's consider a room with n pairs of twins. We want to find the smallest n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%.\n\nUsing the complementary probability, we can calculate the probability that all n pairs of twins have different birthdays. This is equivalent to the probability that no two people share a birthday.\n\nFor n pairs of twins, the probability that all birthdays are different is:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n)\/365)\n\nWe want to find the smallest n such that this probability is less than or equal to 0.5.\n\nAfter calculating the probabilities for different values of n, we find that:\n\n* For n = 12 pairs, the probability of all birthdays being different is approximately 0.507\n* For n = 23 pairs, the probability of all birthdays being different is approximately 0.493\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"294":{"level_0":294,"index":25,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

This frees up all the odd-numbered rooms, and we can put the new guest in room 1.

I walk to my friend's house at 3mph. This means the time it takes to walk to my friend's house is the distance divided by 3mph.\n2. To double my average speed for the entire trip, I need to make the total time for the round trip (walking to my friend's house and running back) equal to half the time it takes to walk to my friend's house.\n3.
