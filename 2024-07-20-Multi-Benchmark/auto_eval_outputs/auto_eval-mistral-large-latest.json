When two people cross together, they must move at the speed of the slower person.\n\nLet's break down the steps to find the fastest time:\n\n1. **Initial Crossing**: A and B cross together (2 minutes, since B is slower).\n2. **Returning the Torch**: A returns with the torch (1 minute).\n3. **Second Crossing**: C and D cross together (10 minutes, since D is slower).\n4. **Returning the Torch**: B returns with the torch (2 minutes).\n5. **Final Crossing**: A and B cross together again (2 minutes).\n\nAdding up the times:\n- First crossing: 2 minutes\n- A returns: 1 minute\n- Second crossing: 10 minutes\n- B returns: 2 minutes\n- Final crossing: 2 minutes\n\nTotal time = 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes\n\nTherefore, the fastest time they can all get across the bridge is 17 minutes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"D\"\n}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"224":{"level_0":224,"index":15,"category":"Puzzle","question":"You're in a room with two doors that lead out.
