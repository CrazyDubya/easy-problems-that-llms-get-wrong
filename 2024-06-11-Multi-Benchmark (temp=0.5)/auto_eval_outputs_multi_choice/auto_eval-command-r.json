Binary searching is effective because it quickly halves the search space with each iteration. This problem can be solved in 24 hours by utilizing the binary search concept and assigning each prisoner a binary number. \n\nThe king should first give each prisoner a cup of wine labeled 000, 001, 010, 011, etc. Then, after 12 hours, check which prisoners are unharmed. The healthy prisoners correspond to the binary numbers of the safe bottles of wine. For the remaining half of the bottles, the process is repeated, and the poison's effect can be observed another 12 hours later. This strategy significantly reduces the number of tests required and ensures the poisoned bottle is found within 24 hours.

The torch adds a constraint that means only one person can cross the bridge at a time.\n\nThe best strategy would be to send the fastest person across first. This gets the fastest person across the bridge in the shortest time, which is 1 minute for person A. Then, person A could return with the torch and accompany the second fastest person (B), who takes 2 minutes to cross the bridge. Meanwhile, the other two people could wait on the starting side of the bridge. This strategy would ensure that the two slowest people don't hold up the entire operation. \n\nHowever, the question doesn't state how long it takes for the torch bearer to return across the bridge. If we assume the return trip is instant, then the total time taken using the above strategy is 3 minutes: 1 minute for A, and 2 minutes for B. But if we factor in the return time for A, then the time increases, and it's no longer the definitive fastest strategy.\n\nWe also don't know if there are any constraints preventing some people from crossing together, such as whether the bridge is wide enough for multiple people at once. If it's wide enough, then two people could cross at the same time, which would further decrease the total time.\n\nTherefore, there is not enough information to determine the definitive fastest time, and I select **C** as the answer.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"164":{"level_0":164,"index":15,"category":"Puzzle","question":"You're in a room with two doors that lead out.

Binary search is efficient as it significantly reduces the number of tests required, especially when dealing with a limited set of items. In this case, the king has 1000 bottles of wine, so logging each item's position in the search space using binary numbers will help. \n\nThe king should organize the bottles in a sequence and divide them into groups of two. Each prisoner will sample from one bottle in each pair. This way, the king can pinpoint the poisoned bottle's general location in the sequence within a few rounds. \n\nIf a prisoner becomes unwell 24 hours after a tasting, the king will know the poisoned bottle lies within the group from which the prisoner sampled. The king can then repeat the process with the bottles in that group, continuing to halve the search space until the poisoned bottle is identified. This strategy ensures the king finds the culprit in the shortest time possible without killing any prisoners.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"227":{"level_0":227,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is a straightforward application of the process of elimination, and should yield accurate results without any ambiguity. Walking into another room to observe the bulbs (Answer A) would not be a practical strategy, as it does not provide information about the switches, and could lead to further confusion. Similarly, turning all switches on at once (Answer C) would not help distinguish which switch controls which bulb. Touching the bulbs to determine which is warm (Answer D) seems like it could be a dangerous approach, and might not even be feasible given that LEDs typically don't emit much heat. Therefore, turning each switch on individually is the best method.","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"286":{"level_0":286,"index":17,"category":"Puzzle","question":"The Poisoned Wine - A king has 1000 sweet bottles of wine, and one contains a very bitter poison.

Binary searching is efficient as it quickly halves the search space with each iteration. \n\nHere's how it could work in practice: Label the 1000 bottles from 0 to 999 and organize them on a table in groups of 100, creating 10 groups. Give each prisoner a number from 0 to 9. First, each prisoner drinks a small amount of wine from the bottle corresponding to the number they're assigned to in the first group. If everyone is fine after 24 hours, the poisoned bottle is not in the first 100. The prisoners then each pick a bottle from the second group (100 to 199), and so on, until a prisoner falls ill. \n\nAt that point, the poisoned bottle is within the last group of bottles that the prisoner sampled. The process would only require a maximum of 10 tests (logging each 100 bottle group) and could be completed in 24 hours, allowing the king to identify the poisoned bottle quickly.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"287":{"level_0":287,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

If you pick Door No. 1 and the host asks about switching to Door No. 2, it's tempting to think that your chances of winning have just halved and that Door No. 2 now offers a 50\/50 chance of success. \n\nHowever, this is not the case. The crucial detail is that the host specifically offered to switch your choice from Door No. 1 to Door No. 2 *only if* Door No. 1 was a losing choice. This means that there are still two possibilities: either Door No. 1 was a winner, in which case switching would indeed be a bad move, or Door No. 1 was a loser, and the host is offering you a chance to correct your initial pick. \n\nSo, after the host's intervention, each of the three doors still has an equal chance of being the winner (1\/3 each).

This approach will reduce the number of tests required and allow him to pinpoint the poisoned bottle within 24 hours. Binary search is efficient as it halves the number of possibilities with each iteration. \n\nHere's how it can be implemented:\n1. Label the bottles from 0 to 999. \n2. Divide the prisoners into two groups of five. \n3. Group 1 tests the bottles by having them numbered from 0 to 499. Group 2 tests bottles numbered from 500 to 999. \n4. After 12 hours, any prisoners who have fallen ill are eliminated from the healthy group, as their bottle was poisoned. The groups can then be adjusted, with prisoners moved from the sick group into the healthy one to maintain a balance of five prisoners in each.\n5. The healthy groups are further subdivided and tested in the same manner, narrowing down the search until the poisoned bottle is identified. \n\nThis approach leverages the binary nature of the numbering system and the 24-hour effect of the poison to efficiently identify the poisoned bottle.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"557":{"level_0":557,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
