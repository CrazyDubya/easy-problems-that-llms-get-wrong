The goal is to identify the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time possible.\n\nOption A is not feasible because it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles of wine, which is impractical and would likely take much longer than 24 hours.\n\nOption C is also not efficient because it would require dividing the 1000 bottles among the 10 prisoners, which means each prisoner would have to sample around 100 bottles. This would still take a significant amount of time and might not even guarantee that the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nOption D is not a viable solution because the poison takes effect 24 hours after consumption, so the prisoners wouldn't be able to taste the bitterness immediately.\n\nOption B, however, is a clever solution that leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle of wine with a binary number from 0 to 999 (since there are 1000 bottles).\n2. Divide the 10 prisoners into two groups: 5 prisoners for the \"ones\" place and 5 prisoners for the \"tens\" place.\n3. For each prisoner, have them sample a subset of bottles corresponding to their binary digit (e.g., prisoner 1 samples bottles with a \"1\" in the ones place, prisoner 2 samples bottles with a \"1\" in the tens place, etc.).\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners die. The combination of dead prisoners will reveal the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 5 die, the poisoned bottle would be the one labeled with the binary number 011 (since prisoners 1 and 3 correspond to the ones place and prisoner 5 corresponds to the tens place).\n\nThis approach allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just 24 hours using only 10 prisoners.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

For the first person, the probability of having a specific birthday is 1\/365. For the second person, the probability of having a different birthday is (365 - 1)\/365, since one birthday is already taken. The probability of both events occurring (i.e., two people having different birthdays) is the product of these probabilities: (1\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365).\n\nFor three people, the probability of all having different birthdays is (1\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365), and so on.\n\nWe want to find the smallest number of people (or pairs of twins) such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is greater than or equal to 50%. This means we need to find the smallest number of people such that the probability of all people having different birthdays is less than or equal to 50%.\n\nUsing a calculator or computer, we can compute the probabilities for different numbers of people:\n\n* 1 person: 1 (obviously, 1 person has a unique birthday)\n* 2 people: 364\/365 \u2248 0.9973 (very likely to have different birthdays)\n* 3 people: (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u2248 0.9925\n* 4 people: (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 (362\/365) \u2248 0.9836\n* ...\n* 23 people: (probability of all having different birthdays) \u2248 0.4927 (less than 50%)\n\nSo, with 23 people (or 23 pairs of twins), the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is greater than or equal to 50%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
