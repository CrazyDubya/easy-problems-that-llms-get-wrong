The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the answer is B and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:**  The king needs to test 1000 bottles with only 10 prisoners and one chance to observe the results (after 24 hours).\n\n* **Why A, C, and D are incorrect:**\n    * **A:** This is impossible and unethical. It would require each prisoner to drink 1000 bottles, ensuring death. \n    * **C:** This only lets you test 10 bottles at most (one per prisoner).\n    * **D:** The poison only takes effect after 24 hours, so tasting bitterness won't help.\n\n* **Why B is correct (Binary Search):**\n\n    1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each bottle a number from 1 to 1000. Convert each bottle number into its binary representation (e.g., bottle 1 is 0000000001, bottle 2 is 0000000010, bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.).\n    2. **Prisoners as Bits:** Each prisoner represents a specific 'bit' position in a 10-digit binary number (since 2^10 = 1024, which is enough to represent numbers up to 1000).\n    3. **Giving Wine:** For each bottle, a prisoner drinks from it if their corresponding 'bit' position in the bottle's binary number is a '1'. For example:\n       * Prisoner 1: Drinks from bottles where the rightmost binary digit is '1' (odd-numbered bottles).\n       * Prisoner 2: Drinks from bottles where the second binary digit from the right is '1' (bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, etc.).\n       * ...and so on.\n    4. **Decoding the Result:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die. Construct a binary number where '1' represents a dead prisoner and '0' a living one. This binary number directly translates back to the poisoned bottle number.\n\n* **Example:** Let's say bottle 5 (binary 0000000101) was poisoned. Prisoners 1 and 3 would die. The resulting binary code would be 0000000101, which translates to bottle number 5.\n\n* **Efficiency:** This method allows you to test up to 1024 bottles using only 10 prisoners, making it the most efficient solution. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
