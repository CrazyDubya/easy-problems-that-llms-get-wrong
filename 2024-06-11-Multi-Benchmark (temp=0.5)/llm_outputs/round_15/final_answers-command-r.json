The crucial detail is that the host specifically offered to switch your choice from Door No. 1 to Door No. 2 *only if* Door No. 1 was a losing choice. This means that there are still two possibilities: either Door No. 1 was a winner, in which case switching would indeed be a bad move, or Door No. 1 was a loser, and the host is offering you a chance to correct your initial pick. \n\nSo, after the host's intervention, each of the three doors still has an equal chance of being the winner (1\/3 each).

With one pair of twins, the likelihood of them sharing a birthday is 1\/365.
