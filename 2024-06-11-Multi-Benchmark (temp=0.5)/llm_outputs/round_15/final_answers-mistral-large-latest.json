Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is to use a binary search strategy. This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number that requires no more than 10 digits (since there are 1000 bottles). For example, the first bottle would be 0000000001, the second 0000000010, the third 0000000011, and so on.\n\n2. For each test, assign one of the 10 prisoners to drink from the set of bottles where the corresponding binary digit is 1. For example, in the first test, the first prisoner would drink from all bottles where the first digit is 1.\n\n3. After 24 hours, if a prisoner dies, the king knows that the bottle he drank from has a 1 in the corresponding position. If no prisoner dies, the king knows that the bottle has a 0 in that position.\n\n4. Repeat this process for each of the 10 digits. After 10 tests, the king will have identified the unique binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just 10 tests (one test per prisoner), and he will know the results within 24 hours.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Since twins share the same birthday, we can treat each pair of twins as a single entity for this problem.\n\nSo, the question becomes: How many entities (or pairs of twins) do you need in a room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two entities share the same birthday?\n\nThis is equivalent to the classic birthday problem, and the answer to that is approximately 23 entities. So, in this case, we would need 23 pairs of twins.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The first pair of twins can have any of the 365 days as their birthday.\n2. The second pair has 364 out of 365 chances to not match the first pair's birthday.\n3. The third pair has 363 out of 365 chances, and so on.\n\nBy the time you get to the 23rd pair, the probability of not sharing a birthday with any of the previous pairs drops below 50%.\n\nSo, the answer is C. 23 pairs.\n\nReturning in JSON format:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
