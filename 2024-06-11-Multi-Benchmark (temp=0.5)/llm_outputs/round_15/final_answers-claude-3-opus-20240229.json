The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"Here is my analysis:\n\nThe key to solving this efficiently is to minimize the number of tests needed to identify the poisoned bottle within the 24 hour time constraint, while leveraging the 10 prisoners available.\n\nA and C would require testing all 1000 bottles which is not feasible in 24 hours. D relies on taste to identify the poison, but the question states the bottles are all sweet wine, so the poison is likely undetectable by taste.\n\nB describes a binary search strategy, assigning each bottle a unique 10-digit binary number where each digit represents a prisoner. For example:\n- Bottle 1: 0000000001  (Prisoner 10 tests this bottle)\n- Bottle 2: 0000000010  (Prisoner 9 tests this bottle)  \n- Bottle 3: 0000000011  (Prisoners 9 and 10 test this bottle)\n...\n- Bottle 1000: 1111101000 (Prisoners 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 test this bottle)\n\nEach prisoner sips the bottles corresponding to a 1 in their digit position. After 24 hours, the subset of prisoners that are poisoned will reveal the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis allows testing 1000 bottles with just 10 prisoners in one 24 hour period, so B is the optimal solution.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
