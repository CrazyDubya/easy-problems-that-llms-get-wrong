When you choose a door, say Door No. 1, there's a 1\/3 chance that it has the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance that the gold bar is behind one of the other two doors.\n3. When the host, who knows what's behind each door, asks if you want to switch and offers you another door, say Door No. 2, they will never open the door with the gold bar. So, if the gold bar wasn't behind Door No. 1, it must be behind Door No. 3 or Door No. 2, but since the host didn't open Door No. 3, it must be behind Door No. 2.\n4.

When your opponent fired the gun and it didn't go off, that means the chamber was empty. Since the gun was spun randomly, the empty chamber could have been in any position with equal probability.\n\nGiven that the gun has six chambers and five bullets, the probability of the empty chamber being in the firing position was 1 out of 6. When your opponent pulled the trigger and nothing happened, that 1 out of 6 chance was used up.\n\nNow, if you were to fire the gun without spinning, there would be a 5 out of 6 chance that you would hit a bullet, because you know the gun didn't fire on the first try.\n\nIf you spin the gun, however, the bullet positions are randomized again, and the chance of hitting a bullet goes back to 5 out of 6. But importantly, there's also a 1 out of 6 chance that the empty chamber ends up in the firing position again.\n\nSo, spinning the gun gives you a 1 out of 6 chance of survival, while not spinning gives you a 1 out of 6 chance of immediate death. Therefore, you should spin the gun to maximize your chances of survival.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is to use a binary search strategy. This strategy allows him to leverage the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\nThe king can label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000, which requires 10 digits (as 2^10 = 1024). Each digit in the binary number corresponds to one of the 10 prisoners. If the digit is 1, the prisoner drinks from the bottle; if it's 0, they don't.\n\nFor example, if the bottle is labeled with the binary number 1010101010, the first, third, fifth, seventh, and ninth prisoners would drink from it.\n\nAfter 24 hours, the king can look at the prisoners who have fallen ill. Their positions in the line correspond to the digits that were 1 in the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nSo, if the first, third, and seventh prisoners are ill, the binary number of the poisoned bottle is 1010001 (which is 81 in decimal).\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours, using only 10 prisoners.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
