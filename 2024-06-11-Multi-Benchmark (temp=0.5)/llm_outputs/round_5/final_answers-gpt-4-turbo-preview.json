When you first choose a door (say No. 1), there is a 1\/3 chance of picking the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance it's behind one of the other doors. If the host, who knows what's behind each door, then offers you the chance to switch to door No. 2 (assuming door No. 3 is not mentioned or eliminated as an option), the probability doesn't just split evenly between the two remaining doors because the host's action adds information to the problem.\n\nThe key is that the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge of what's behind the doors. If you stick with your original choice (door No. 1), your chances remain at 1\/3. However, switching doors (to door No. 2 in this scenario) effectively gives you the odds of what you didn't pick initially, which combines the probability of the two doors you didn't choose, making it 2\/3.\n\nSo, switching doors (to door No. 2, as door No. 3 isn't the focus of the switch in the provided scenario) gives you a bigger advantage.

The boat has three separate compartments, which means the farmer can transport any combination of the wolf, goat, and cabbage at the same time without them interacting. However, the key limitation is that the farmer can only take a maximum of two of them (in separate compartments) across the river in any single crossing, and he must be present to steer the boat.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution:\n1. The farmer takes the goat across the river first, leaving the wolf and the cabbage on the initial side. This avoids any immediate danger, as the wolf won't eat the cabbage. (1 crossing)\n2. The farmer returns alone to the original side to get either the wolf or the cabbage. Let's say he takes the wolf next. (2 crossings)\n3. The farmer leaves the wolf on the other side but takes the goat back with him to the original side. This ensures that the wolf won't eat the goat while he's gone. (3 crossings)\n4. The farmer then takes the cabbage across the river, leaving it with the wolf. Since the wolf doesn't eat cabbage, this is safe. (4 crossings)\n5. Finally, the farmer returns to the original side to get the goat. (5 crossings)\n\nSo, the minimum number of crossings needed to bring the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage across the river without anything being eaten, given the constraints, is five.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"5":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"Bob has three boxes in front of him - Box A, Box B and Box C.

If the hotel is partially full, it means there are guests occupying some of the rooms, but there are still an infinite number of empty rooms available. To accommodate one more guest, the most efficient method without specifying the current occupancy details is to ask each current guest to move to the next room (for example, from room n to room n+1). This action creates a domino effect of vacating the current room of each guest, thereby freeing up the first room (or any specific room) for the new guest. This method ensures that all current guests still have a room, and the new guest is also accommodated without the need to specify which rooms are initially empty.
