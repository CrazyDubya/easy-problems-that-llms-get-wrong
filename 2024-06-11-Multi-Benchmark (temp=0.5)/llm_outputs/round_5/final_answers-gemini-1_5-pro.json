Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nD. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is B and how it works:\n\n* **A is incorrect** because the poison is tasteless (only described as bitter), and the prompt asks for the fastest way to identify the poisoned bottle.\n* **C is incorrect** because it would lead to the death of all prisoners who sampled from the poisoned bottle. \n* **D is incorrect** because it is impractical and would require each prisoner to sample 1000 bottles.\n\n**B is correct** because it utilizes the concept of binary search to efficiently pinpoint the poisoned bottle:\n\n1. **Numbering:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.  Number the bottles using binary from 0000000001 (1) to 1111101000 (1000).\n2. **Sampling:** Each prisoner drinks from bottles where their corresponding binary digit is a '1'. For example:\n    * Prisoner 1 drinks from bottles: 1, 3, 5, 7... (all odd-numbered bottles)\n    * Prisoner 2 drinks from bottles: 2, 3, 6, 7... \n    * Prisoner 3 drinks from bottles: 4, 5, 6, 7... and so on.\n3. **Observation:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners died.  Construct a binary number where '1' represents a dead prisoner and '0' a living one.  This binary number directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\n**Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0001001001, which translates to the decimal number 257. Therefore, bottle number 257 is poisoned.\n\n**Efficiency:** This method guarantees finding the poisoned bottle within 24 hours using the fewest prisoners possible.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
