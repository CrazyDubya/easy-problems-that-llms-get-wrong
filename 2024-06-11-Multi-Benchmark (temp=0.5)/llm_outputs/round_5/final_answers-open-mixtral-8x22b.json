The winners of these races advance to the next round.\n\nNext, race the three winners from the first round (1 race). The winner of this race is the fastest horse.\n\nSo, the total number of races needed is 3 (first round) + 1 (final race) = 4 races.

Then, turn off switch A and turn on switch B, again observing which light bulb turns on. Finally, turn off switch B and turn on switch C, observing which light bulb turns on. This way, you can determine which switch corresponds to which light bulb.\n\nSince the light bulbs are LED and do not get warm when turned on, touching the bulbs to determine which one is on is not a viable option. Additionally, turning on all switches at once will not allow you to determine which switch corresponds to which light bulb. Walking into another room to observe the bulbs is also not necessary, as the bulbs are in the same room.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"17":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"The Poisoned Wine - A king has 1000 sweet bottles of wine, and one contains a very bitter poison.

This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and allows the king to know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. The king assigns each prisoner a unique binary number from 0 to 1023 (which can be represented using 10 bits). For example, prisoner 1 is assigned 0000000001, prisoner 2 is assigned 0000000010, and so on.\n\n2. The king then assigns each bottle of wine a unique binary number from 1 to 1000.\n\n3. Each prisoner takes a sip from the bottles of wine that correspond to the \"1\" bits in their binary number. For example, prisoner 1 (0000000001) will take a sip from bottle 1, prisoner 2 (0000000010) will take a sip from bottle 2, and so on.\n\n4. After 24 hours, the king checks which prisoners have been poisoned. The binary numbers of the poisoned prisoners can be added together to find the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1 (0000000001), 3 (0000000100), and 7 (0000011100) are poisoned, their binary numbers can be added together to get the binary number of the poisoned bottle: 0000100001, which corresponds to bottle 33.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Therefore, we set up the equation:\n\n2d \/ (d\/3 + d\/x) = 2 * 3\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n2d \/ (d\/3 + d\/x) = 6\nMultiplying both sides by (d\/3 + d\/x) and simplifying, we get:\n2d = 6 * (d\/3 + d\/x)\n2 = 2 + 6\/x\nSubtracting 2 from both sides, we get:\n0 = 6\/x\nMultiplying both sides by x, we get:\n0 = 6\n\nThis equation has no solution, which means that it is not possible to double the average speed for the entire trip by running back at any finite speed.
