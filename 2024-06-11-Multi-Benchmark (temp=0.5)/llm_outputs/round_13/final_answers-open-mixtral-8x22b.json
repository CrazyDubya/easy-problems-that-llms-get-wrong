What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n\nExplanation:\nThe fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This method minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles of wine into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from one bottle in their assigned group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours. If a prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in that group. If no one dies, then the poisoned bottle is not in any of the groups tested.\n4. Repeat the process with the group that contains the poisoned bottle, dividing it into 10 smaller groups of 10 bottles each. Assign each group to a different prisoner and have them drink from one bottle in their assigned group.\n5. Wait for 24 hours. If a prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in that group of 10. If no one dies, then the poisoned bottle is not in any of the groups tested.\n6. Repeat this process until you have identified the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle with the fewest number of tests possible, and it guarantees that he will know the results within 24 hours. Answers A, C, and D are not optimal because they either require too many tests or do not guarantee that the king will know the results within 24 hours.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
