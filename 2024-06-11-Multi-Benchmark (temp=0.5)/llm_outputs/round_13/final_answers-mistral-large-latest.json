However, this would only give you the fastest horse in that particular race, not necessarily the fastest overall. This is because the second fastest horse in the first race might be slower than the fastest horse in a subsequent race.\n\nTo ensure accuracy, you would need to conduct a second race with the top two horses from the first race.

This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique 10-digit binary number (since 1024 is greater than 1000, this will cover all bottles).\n2. For each test, prepare a mixture of wines corresponding to a specific digit in the binary number. If the digit is 1, include the wine; if it's 0, don't.\n3. Give each prisoner one of these mixtures to drink.\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners have died. The position of the dead prisoner corresponds to the digit that identifies the poisoned bottle.\n5. Repeat this process for each digit in the binary number.\n\nThis method allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just 10 tests (one test per digit in the binary number), and he will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
