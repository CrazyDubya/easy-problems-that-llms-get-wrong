The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"Here is my analysis:\n\nThe key to solving this efficiently is to minimize the number of tests needed to identify the poisoned bottle within the 24 hour time limit, while leveraging the 10 prisoners available.\n\nA binary search strategy (Answer B) is the optimal approach. Here's how it would work:\n- Number the bottles from 1 to 1000\n- Have each prisoner sample wine from specific bottles based on the binary representation of the bottle numbers\n- After 24 hours, the prisoners who sampled from the poisoned bottle will have died\n- The numbers of the dead prisoners will reveal the binary encoding of the poisoned bottle's number\n\nFor example:\n- Prisoner 1 samples from all odd numbered bottles (binary 1, 11, 101, 111, etc.) \n- Prisoner 2 samples from bottles divisible by 2 but not 4 (binary 10, 110, 1010, etc.)\n- Prisoner 3 samples from bottles divisible by 4 but not 8 (binary 100, 1100, 10100, etc.)\n- And so on for the remaining prisoners\n\nAfter 24 hours, if prisoners 1, 4, and 8 died, that would mean the poisoned bottle's number has a binary encoding of 10010100, or decimal 148.\n\nThis strategy only requires 10 tests (one per prisoner) to test up to 1024 bottles, so it will identify the single poisoned bottle out of 1000 total bottles within the 24 hour limit.\n\nThe other answers are much less efficient:\n\nA and C would require testing all 1000 bottles which isn't possible in 24 hours with only 10 prisoners. \nD relies on taste which is subjective and error-prone compared to the certain lethality of the poison.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
