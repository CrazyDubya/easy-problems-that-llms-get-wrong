Option A is not feasible because it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is impractical and would likely kill all the prisoners.\n\nOption C is also not the best approach because it would require dividing the 1000 bottles among the 10 prisoners, which means each prisoner would have to sample around 100 bottles. This would increase the chances of multiple prisoners dying, making it difficult to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nOption D is not a viable solution because the poison takes effect in 24 hours, so the prisoners wouldn't be able to taste the bitterness immediately.\n\nThe correct answer is Option B. By using a binary search strategy, the king can identify the poisoned bottle in just 24 hours. Here's how:\n\n1. Assign a unique binary number to each bottle of wine, from 0 to 999 (using 10 binary digits).\n2. Divide the 10 prisoners into two groups: 5 prisoners for the \"0\" group and 5 prisoners for the \"1\" group.\n3. For each binary digit, have the prisoners in the \"0\" group drink from the bottles with a 0 in that digit position, and have the prisoners in the \"1\" group drink from the bottles with a 1 in that digit position.\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners have died. The binary digits corresponding to the dead prisoners will indicate the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 5 die, the poisoned bottle would have a binary number with 1's in the 1st, 3rd, and 5th digit positions. By combining these digits, the king can identify the exact bottle.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it uses the prisoners to test multiple bottles simultaneously, reducing the number of tests needed to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nHere's the answer in JSON format:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

We can approach this by calculating the probability that no two people share the same birthday and then subtracting that from 1.\n\nLet's assume we have n pairs of twins in the room, which means there are 2n people in total. We want to find the smallest value of n such that the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday is at least 50%.\n\nThe probability that the first person has a unique birthday is 1 (certainty). The probability that the second person has a different birthday from the first is 364\/365, since there are 364 remaining days in the year. The probability that the third person has a different birthday from the first two is 363\/365, and so on.\n\nThe probability that all 2n people have different birthdays is therefore:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-2n+1)\/365)\n\nWe want to find the smallest value of n such that the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday is at least 50%. This means we want to find the smallest value of n such that the probability that all 2n people have different birthdays is less than or equal to 50%.\n\nUsing a calculator or computer program to calculate the probability for different values of n, we find that when n = 23, the probability that all 46 people have different birthdays is approximately 49.03%.
