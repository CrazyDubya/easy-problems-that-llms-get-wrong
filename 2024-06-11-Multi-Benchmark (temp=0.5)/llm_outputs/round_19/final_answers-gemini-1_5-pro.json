Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"A\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why option A is the correct answer and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:** Identify one poisoned bottle out of 1000 with only 10 prisoners and 24 hours before the poison takes effect.\n\n* **Why Binary Search (Option A) is Optimal:**\n    * **Efficiency:** Binary search is famous for its speed in finding a specific item in a sorted set. While we aren't technically 'sorting', the principle applies.\n    * **How it Works:**\n        1. **Number the Bottles:** Assign each bottle a number from 1 to 1000.\n        2. **Convert to Binary:** Convert each bottle's number into its binary equivalent (e.g., Bottle 1 is 0000000001, Bottle 2 is 0000000010, Bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.).\n        3. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a digit position in the binary numbers (Prisoner 1 gets the ones place, Prisoner 2 gets the twos place, and so on up to Prisoner 10).\n        4. **Give Wine Based on Binary:** Each prisoner drinks from a bottle if their corresponding binary digit position for that bottle's number is a '1'. For example:\n            * Bottle 5 (binary 0000000101): Prisoners 1 and 3 would drink from this bottle.\n            * Bottle 12 (binary 0000001100): Prisoners 3 and 4 would drink from this bottle. \n        5. **Observe After 24 Hours:** The prisoners who die represent the '1' digits in the binary representation of the poisoned bottle number.  If Prisoner 1, Prisoner 4, and Prisoner 5 die, you know the binary number is 0010000101, which converts to decimal 525 \u2013 that's the poisoned bottle.\n\n* **Why Other Options Fail:**\n    * **B:**  Highly inefficient and likely kills all prisoners.\n    * **C:** The poison is tasteless; the problem states it's only detectable by its effect after 24 hours.\n    * **D:**  Similar to B, this is inefficient and unnecessarily risky for the prisoners.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This means there's a 364\/365 chance they do NOT share a birthday.\n* **Multiple Pairs:**  As we add more pairs of twins, we keep multiplying the probability of NO shared birthday between any of them.  \n* **Reaching 50%:**  We want to find the point where the probability of NO shared birthdays dips below 50%.  Mathematically, we're looking for when (364\/365)^n becomes less than 0.5 (where 'n' is the number of pairs).\n* **Calculation:** It turns out that when 'n' (number of pairs) is around 23, this probability goes below 50%. \n\nTherefore, you need approximately 23 pairs of twins to have at least a 50% chance of two people sharing a birthday.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
