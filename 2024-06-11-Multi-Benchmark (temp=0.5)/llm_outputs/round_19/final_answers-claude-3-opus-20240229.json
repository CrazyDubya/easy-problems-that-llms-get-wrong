The king can number the bottles from 1 to 1000 and represent each number in binary using the 10 prisoners. Each prisoner is assigned a bit position. The prisoners sample the wine from the bottles corresponding to the numbers where their assigned bit is 1. After 24 hours, the prisoners who sampled the poisoned wine will have died.

By pulling the lever, you would be actively intervening to prevent the deaths of those five individuals. \n\nHowever, the question does not specify whether there are any people on the other track that the trolley would be diverted to. If the other track is empty, then pulling the lever is the most ethical choice as it would save five lives. But if there are people on the other track, then you would be faced with the classic \"trolley problem\" where you must decide whether to take action to save a greater number of lives at the cost of sacrificing a smaller number.\n\nUltimately, I believe that pulling the lever is the right ethical choice regardless, as it minimizes the loss of life by saving the five people.
