This means that we cannot use temperature as a way to determine which switch controls which light bulb.\n\nThe best approach is to use a process of elimination by turning each switch on one at a time and observing the bulbs. This way, we can determine which switch controls which light bulb without any ambiguity.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Turn switch A on and observe the bulbs.

By using a binary search strategy, we can leverage the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Assign each bottle a unique binary number from 0 to 999 (using 10 binary digits).\n2. Divide the prisoners into two groups of 5.\n3. For each binary digit (0-9), have one group of 5 prisoners drink the wine from the bottles with a 0 in that digit, and the other group drink the wine from the bottles with a 1 in that digit.\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners died and which survived.\n5. Use the results to determine the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nWith 10 prisoners, we can test 10 binary digits in parallel, which allows us to narrow down the search to a single bottle in just one iteration.

We want to find the smallest value of x such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%.\n\nTo approach this, let's calculate the probability that no two people share a birthday. This is equivalent to each person having a unique birthday. Since there are 365 possible birthdays (ignoring February 29th for simplicity), the probability of the first person having a unique birthday is 365\/365 = 1. The probability of the second person having a unique birthday (different from the first) is 364\/365, the third person is 363\/365, and so on.\n\nThe probability of no two people sharing a birthday is the product of these probabilities:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-2x+1)\/365)\n\nWe want to find the smallest value of x such that this probability is less than or equal to 0.5. After calculating the probabilities for different values of x, we find that:\n\n* For x = 12 pairs (24 people), the probability of no two people sharing a birthday is approximately 0.493, which is still greater than 0.5.\n* For x = 23 pairs (46 people), the probability of no two people sharing a birthday is approximately 0.493, which is still greater than 0.5.\n* For x = 23.5 pairs (47 people), the probability of no two people sharing a birthday is approximately 0.492, which is less than 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
