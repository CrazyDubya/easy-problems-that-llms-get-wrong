Even if you raced all 6 at once, you would only know the fastest of those 6, but not how the others rank.\n\nWith two races of 3 horses each, you could find the fastest of each group of 3. Then by racing those two winners, you could find the overall fastest. However, this doesn't let you rank the remaining 4 horses.\n\nTo fully rank all 6 horses with the minimum number of races, you need to do this:\n- Race 1: Horses A, B, C \n- Race 2: Horses D, E, F\nThis establishes the order within each group of 3.\n- Race 3: 1st place from Race 1 vs 2nd place from Race 2\n- Race 4: 2nd place from Race 1 vs 1st place from Race 2 \nThis cross-compares the top 2 from each initial group.\n- Race 5: Loser of Race 3 vs Winner of Race 4\nThis establishes 2nd and 3rd place overall.\n\nSo in summary, the minimum number of races needed to fully rank 6 horses is 5.
