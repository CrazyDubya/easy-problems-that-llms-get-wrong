Divide the bottles amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter:** This is not a viable option as the poison is undetectable by taste. \n* **B. Divide the bottles amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours:** This approach is inefficient and unnecessarily risks the lives of 9 prisoners. \n* **C. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners:** This is the most efficient approach. We can assign each prisoner a unique binary code from 0 to 9. Each prisoner will then taste the wines corresponding to the 1s in their binary code. After 24 hours, we will know which prisoner died (if any). The binary code of the deceased prisoner will reveal the poisoned bottle (e.g., if prisoner 5 died, the poisoned bottle is the 5th one). This method requires a maximum of 10 tastings to identify the culprit.\n* **D. Get all prisoners to sample each of the bottles:** This is highly inefficient and unnecessarily exposes all prisoners to the risk of the poison. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the optimal solution is **C.
