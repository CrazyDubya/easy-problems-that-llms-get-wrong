You choose a door, let's say door No. 1, but you aren't shown what's behind it yet. The host, who knows what's behind each door, then opens another door, say No. 2, which has a rotten vegetable. The host then gives you the option to switch your choice to the remaining unopened door, No. 3.\n\nThe question is, should you stick with your initial choice (door No. 1) or switch to the other unopened door (door No. 3)?\n\nThe answer, counterintuitively, is that you should switch to door No. 3. Here's why:\n\nWhen you initially chose door No. 1, the probability of it having the gold bar was 1\/3, and the probability of either door No. 2 or door No. 3 having the gold bar was 2\/3. When the host reveals a rotten vegetable behind door No. 2, this doesn't change the initial probabilities. The probability that the gold bar is behind door No. 1 is still 1\/3, but the entire 2\/3 probability that the gold bar is behind either door No. 2 or door No. 3 is now concentrated on door No. 3, since we know door No. 2 has a rotten vegetable.\n\nSo, switching your choice to door No. 3 gives you a higher probability of winning the gold bar.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This is because the light bulbs are LED and do not get warm when turned on, so touching the bulbs to see which is warm and which one is on (Option A) will not work. Also, since the bulbs are in the same room, walking into another room to observe the bulbs (Option C) is not necessary. Turning all of the switches on at once and observing the bulbs (Option D) will not allow you to determine which switch turns on which bulb.
