Here's how it works:\\n\\n1. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\\n2. **Number the Bottles:**  Imagine each bottle has a binary number assigned (1-1000 in binary is 0000000001 - 1111101000). \\n3. **Assign Wine:** Each prisoner will drink from bottles based on their corresponding binary digit. For example:\\n    * Prisoner 1: Drinks from every bottle where the *last* binary digit is a 1.\\n    * Prisoner 2: Drinks from every bottle where the *second to last* binary digit is a 1.\\n    * ...and so on.\\n4. **Observe After 24 Hours:** Note which prisoners die. If a prisoner dies, it means the poisoned bottle had a '1' in their corresponding binary position. \\n5. **Construct the Binary Number:** Create a binary number based on the dead\/alive status of the prisoners. For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number would be 0001100001, converting to 225 in decimal. This means bottle number 225 is poisoned.\\n\\n**This method is the fastest because it utilizes a process of elimination that can pinpoint a single bottle out of 1000 in just one round of testing.**\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

With two pairs of twins, the probability the third pair doesn't share a birthday with the first two is 363\/365, and so on.\n* **Finding the tipping point:** We need to keep adding pairs of twins and multiplying the decreasing probabilities until the product dips below 50%.\n\nAfter calculating, you'll find that with 23 pairs of twins (46 total people), the probability of no shared birthday drops below 50%, meaning there's a greater than 50% chance of a shared birthday.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
