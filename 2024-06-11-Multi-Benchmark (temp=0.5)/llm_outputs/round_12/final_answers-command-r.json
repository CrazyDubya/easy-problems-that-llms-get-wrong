The closest we can get is 3 gallons from the 3-gallon jug or 4 gallons from the 4-gallon jug. We cannot measure 1 gallon directly, and any attempts to transfer water between the jugs will result in either more or less than 1 gallon being measured out.

When the tree has grown to 3kg, the mass of the pot and soil must be at least 3kg, because the tree itself now weighs 3kg. So we can rule out 10kg and 11kg as answers. \n\nThe remaining options are 8kg and 9kg. We know the pot and soil originally weighed 10kg, and the tree has gained 3kg in weight, a total of 7kg of mass has therefore been 'used' by the tree. It's reasonable to assume the soil mass has remained constant, and been wholly incorporated into the tree's growth. This leads us to conclude the pot now contains 3kg tree + 8kg soil = 11kg total mass. Therefore the correct answer is B: 8kg.","score":""},"29":{"category":"Relational","question":"A man steps over a 0.5m hurdle.
