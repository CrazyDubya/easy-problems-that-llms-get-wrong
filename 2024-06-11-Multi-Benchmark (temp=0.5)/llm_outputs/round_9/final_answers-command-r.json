This means six horses would require 15 races (picking one as the control horse, the other four race each other and then the winner races the control horse). Since this number doesn't divide evenly into pairs, the minimum number of races needed is three, to whittle it down to the final three horses. With three races, the six horses can be divided into two groups of three, with the winners of each group racing each other to determine the overall winner.","score":""},"2":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a gold bar; behind the others, rotten vegetables.

The crucial point here is that the host doesn't offer to switch unless you pick a losing door. \n\nIf you picked the gold bar behind door No. 1, the host wouldn't offer you a chance to switch, so the only way to be certain of a win is to stick with your initial choice of door No. 1.

With one pair of twins, the likelihood of them having the same birthday is approximately 1\/730, which is less than 50%. \n\nTo get the probability over 50%, we'll assume each pair of twins only counts as one person with two birthdays, one for each twin. We'd need 12 people with different birthdays to have a 50% chance of finding a match. So, the number of pairs of twins required would be 12 \/ 2, which is 6.
