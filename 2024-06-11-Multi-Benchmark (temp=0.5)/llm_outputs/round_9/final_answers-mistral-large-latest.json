Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is to use a binary search strategy. This strategy allows him to test multiple bottles at once and eliminate large groups of bottles in a single test.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nThe king can assign each prisoner a binary number from 0 to 1010 (10 in binary), and give each prisoner a sip from the bottles corresponding to the '1's in their binary number. For example, prisoner 1 (0001 in binary) would test bottles 1, prisoner 2 (0010 in binary) would test bottles 2, prisoner 3 (0011 in binary) would test bottles 1 and 3, and so on.\n\nIf a prisoner dies, the king knows that the poisoned bottle is one of the bottles that prisoner tested. By looking at the binary numbers of the dead prisoners, the king can determine exactly which bottle is poisoned.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 2, and 4 die, the king knows that the poisoned bottle is bottle 4, because 4 is the only number that has a '1' in the first, second, and fourth positions in its binary representation (0100).\n\nThis strategy allows the king to test all 1000 bottles with only 10 prisoners in a single day.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
