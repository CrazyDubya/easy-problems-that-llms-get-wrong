Even if you raced all 6 at once, you would only know the winner of that race, not necessarily the overall fastest horse.\n\nTwo races also isn't enough. For example, if you split the horses into two groups of 3, the winners of those two races could be the 2nd and 3rd fastest overall. You wouldn't know which of those two was actually fastest.\n\nWith three races, you can find the fastest horse. Race the horses in two groups of 3. Then take the winners of those two races and race them head-to-head. The winner of that final race is guaranteed to be the fastest of the original 6, since it will have beaten the winner of the other group.\n\nSo the minimum number of races needed to find the fastest of 6 horses is three.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"2":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a gold bar; behind the others, rotten vegetables.

By assigning each bottle a unique 10-digit binary number and having each prisoner sample the bottles corresponding to their assigned digit (e.g. prisoner 1 samples bottles ending in 1, prisoner 2 samples bottles ending in 2, etc.), the poisoned bottle can be identified from the subset of prisoners who die within 24 hours.

Each pair of twins shares the same birthday.\n2. We need to find the number of pairs such that the probability of no two people sharing the same birthday is less than 50%.\n3. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n   P(no shared birthdays) = (365 \/ 365) * (364 \/ 365) * (363 \/ 365) * ... * ((365 - n + 1) \/ 365)\n\n   where n is the number of people in the room.\n\n4. Since each pair of twins counts as two people, we need to find the value of n such that P(no shared birthdays) < 0.5.\n5. By trial and error or using a calculator, we find that for n = 23, P(no shared birthdays) \u2248 0.493, which is less than 0.5.\n6. Since 23 people correspond to 11.5 pairs of twins, we round up to 12 pairs to ensure that the probability is at least 50%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A. 12 pairs of twins are needed in a room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

By taking action to switch the track, you would be directly intervening to rescue those five individuals from imminent mortal danger.\n\nHowever, the question does not specify whether there are any people on the other track that the trolley would be diverted to. If the other track is empty, then pulling the lever is clearly the right ethical choice to save five lives. But if there are people on the other track who would be killed by the diverted trolley, then it becomes a challenging ethical dilemma. Inaction would lead to five deaths, but the action of pulling the lever would make one morally culpable for the deaths on the other track. Different ethical frameworks would analyze this dilemma differently.\n\nGiven that the question simply asks about the impact on the five people's lives and assumes the other track is empty, I will select Answer A.
