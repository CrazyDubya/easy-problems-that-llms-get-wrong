We can find the poisoned bottle without anyone having to consume any poison.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the poison is not necessarily bitter, and even if it were, the prisoners might not be able to taste it.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it risks the lives of all the prisoners and is not necessary to find the poisoned bottle.\n\nOption B is the correct answer. Using a binary search strategy, the king can divide the bottles among the prisoners in such a way that they can identify the poisoned bottle with a minimum number of tests. Here's how it would work:\n\n1. Divide the bottles into 10 groups of 100. Give each group to a different prisoner.\n2. Wait 24 hours. The prisoner who drank from the poisoned group will die.\n3. Divide the remaining 900 bottles into 9 groups of 100. Give each group to a different prisoner (excluding the one who died).\n4. Wait 24 hours. The prisoner who drank from the poisoned group will die.\n5. Repeat this process until only one bottle remains. This is the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis strategy minimizes the number of tests needed to find the poisoned bottle and does not risk the lives of any prisoners unnecessarily.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
