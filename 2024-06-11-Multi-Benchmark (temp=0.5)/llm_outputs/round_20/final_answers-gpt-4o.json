You have two guardians, one who always tells the truth (but guards the death door) and one who always lies.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the problem**: You don't know which guardian is which, and you don't know which door leads to freedom.\n2. **Formulate a strategy**: You need a question that will give you the correct door regardless of which guardian you ask.\n\nThe classic solution to this type of puzzle involves asking a question that forces both guardians to give the same answer, leading you to the door of freedom. The question you can ask is:\n- \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n- If you ask the truth-telling guardian, they will truthfully tell you that the lying guardian would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the lying guardian, they will lie about what the truth-telling guardian would say, and thus also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the door they point to is the death door. Therefore, you should choose the opposite door to ensure your safety.\n\nSo, you only need to ask one question to determine the door to freedom.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.
