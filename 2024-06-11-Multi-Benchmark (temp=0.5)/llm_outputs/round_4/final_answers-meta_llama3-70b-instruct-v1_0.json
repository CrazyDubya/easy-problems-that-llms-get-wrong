However, we can do this efficiently by using a process of elimination. Here's one way to do it:\n\n1. Race 3 horses against each other. This gives us a ranking of these 3 horses (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd).\n2. Take the winner of the first race and race it against one of the remaining 3 horses. If the winner of the first race wins again, it's the fastest horse. If not, the new winner is the fastest horse so far.\n3. Take the fastest horse so far and race it against the last remaining horse. If the fastest horse wins, it's the overall fastest horse.

Since one guardian always tells the truth and the other always lies, we can use this to our advantage.\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\n1. We can ask one of the guardians, \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible responses:\n\n* If the truth-teller is asked, they will tell us what the liar would say, which would be the wrong door (i.e., the door leading to death).\n* If the liar is asked, they will lie about what the truth-teller would say, which means they will point to the wrong door (i.e., the door leading to death) again.\n\nSo, regardless of who we ask, the response will always steer us away from the door leading to death. This means we can safely assume the other door leads to freedom.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of questions needed is one.\n\nHere's my answer in JSON format:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

Option A is not the best approach because it would require each prisoner to test 100 bottles, which would be a waste of resources. Option B is not feasible because it would require each prisoner to test all 1000 bottles, which is impractical. Option D is not possible because the poison takes effect 24 hours after consumption, so the prisoners wouldn't be able to taste the bitterness immediately.\n\nThe correct approach is Option C, which uses a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into two groups of 500 each.\n2. Have one prisoner test one group, and another prisoner test the other group.\n3. Wait 24 hours, and observe which prisoners die. If both prisoners die, the poisoned bottle is in one of the two groups. If only one prisoner dies, the poisoned bottle is in the other group.\n4. Repeat the process, dividing the remaining group of 500 (or 250, or 125, etc.) into two subgroups, and having two prisoners test each subgroup.\n5. Continue this process until you're left with only one bottle, which is the poisoned one.\n\nThis approach leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.

This is a classic problem known as the \"birthday problem.\"\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n\nWhen there's only one person in the room, the probability that they have a specific birthday is 1\/365. When we add a second person, the probability that they have a different birthday than the first person is 364\/365, since there's one fewer day to choose from. The probability that both people have different birthdays is therefore (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) = 364\/365.\n\nAs we add more people to the room, the probability that all of them have different birthdays decreases. When we have n people in the room, the probability that all of them have different birthdays is:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365)\n\nWe want to find the smallest value of n such that the probability that at least two people share a birthday is at least 50%. This means that the probability that all n people have different birthdays should be less than or equal to 50%.\n\nUsing a calculator or computer to compute the probabilities, we find that when n = 23, the probability that all 23 people have different birthdays is approximately 49.3%, which is less than 50%. Therefore, with 23 people in the room, there's at least a 50% chance that two people share a birthday.\n\nSince we're asked to find the number of pairs of twins, we need to divide 23 by 2, which gives us 11.5 pairs. However, since we can't have a fraction of a pair, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 12 pairs. But wait, this is not among the answer choices!\n\nThe correct answer is actually C. 23 people, not pairs of twins.
