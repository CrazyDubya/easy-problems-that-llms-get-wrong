This is because we know one chamber is empty. \n\nThere are two scenarios to consider:\n\n1. **Spinning the chamber:** If you spin the chamber, the empty chamber will be randomly distributed among the six chambers. This means the probability of the gun firing on the next pull remains 5\/6, as each chamber has an equal chance of being under the hammer.\n\n2. **Not spinning the chamber:** If you don't spin the chamber, the empty chamber remains in its current position. Since you don't know the position of the empty chamber, the probability of the gun firing on the next pull is 1\/6, as there is only one chamber with a bullet and you have a 1\/6 chance of selecting it.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTherefore, spinning the chamber makes no difference to the probability of the gun firing.

Ask **either guardian**: \"**Which door would the other guardian say leads to freedom?**\"\n\nHere's why this works:\n\n* If you ask the **Truthful Guardian**, they will **lie** about what the **Lying Guardian** would say. Since the Lying Guardian always points to the **freedom door**, the Truthful Guardian will **lie and point to the death door**.\n* If you ask the **Lying Guardian**, they will **tell the truth** about what the **Truthful Guardian** would say. Since the Truthful Guardian always points to the **death door**, the Lying Guardian will **tell the truth and also point to the death door**.\n\nTherefore, regardless of which guardian you ask, **the door they point to will be the death door**. Consequently, the **other door** must be the **door to freedom**.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nBy asking a single question, \"Which door would the other guardian say leads to freedom?\", you can identify the door to freedom with certainty. \n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n``` \n","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

This involves calculating the probability of **no shared birthdays** and subtracting it from 1. \n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Probability of No Shared Birthdays:**\n\nFor the first twin pair, the probability of having different birthdays is 364\/365 (as one day is already taken by the first twin). For the second pair, the probability becomes 363\/365 (as two days are taken), and so on. \n\nTherefore, the probability of **no shared birthdays** for all pairs is:\n\n```\n(364\/365) * (363\/365) * ... * (320\/365) \n```\n\n2. **Complementary Probability:**\n\nThe probability of **at least one shared birthday** is the complement of having no shared birthdays.

Using trial and error or a calculator, we find that:\n\n- For 22 pairs, the probability is approximately 47.5%.\n- For 23 pairs, the probability jumps to approximately 50.6%.\n\nTherefore, we need **23 pairs of twins** for a 50% or greater chance of at least one shared birthday.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe answer is: \n\n```json\n{\n\"ANSWER\": \"C\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
