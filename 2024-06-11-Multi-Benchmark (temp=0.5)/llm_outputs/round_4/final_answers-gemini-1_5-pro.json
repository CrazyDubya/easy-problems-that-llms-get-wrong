The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nC. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"```json\n{\n\"ANSWER\": \"C\",\n\"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is C and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:** Identify one poisoned bottle out of 1000 with only 10 prisoners and 24 hours before the poison takes effect.\n\n* **Why A, B, and D are incorrect:**\n    * **A & D:**  These methods are inefficient and rely on the prisoners dying, which is morally unacceptable.\n    * **B:** Logistically impossible. Each prisoner would need to take 100 sips, making it impossible to complete in 24 hours.\n\n* **Why C is correct: Binary Search**\n\n    1. **Numbering:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.  Think of these as places in a binary number (e.g., prisoner 1 is the 'ones' place, prisoner 2 is the 'twos' place, prisoner 3 is the 'fours' place, and so on).\n\n    2. **Labeling Bottles:**  Number the wine bottles from 1 to 1000. Convert each bottle number to its binary representation (e.g., bottle 1 is 0000000001, bottle 2 is 0000000010, bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.).\n\n    3. **Giving Sips:** Each prisoner drinks from bottles where the binary representation of the bottle number has a '1' in the position corresponding to their prisoner number. For example:\n       * Prisoner 1 drinks from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7... (all odd-numbered bottles)\n       * Prisoner 2 drinks from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11... \n       * Prisoner 3 drinks from bottles 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15...\n\n    4. **Decoding the Result:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died. Construct a binary number where:\n        * '1' represents a dead prisoner.\n        * '0' represents a living prisoner.\n\n     This binary number directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle number!\n\n* **Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0010100001, which converts to the decimal number 577. Therefore, bottle 577 is poisoned.\n\n* **Efficiency:**  This method is incredibly efficient because 2^10 = 1024. This means you can test up to 1024 bottles using only 10 prisoners. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
