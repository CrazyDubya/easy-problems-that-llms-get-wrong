The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nC. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"Here is my analysis of the question and answer choices:\n\nUsing a simple divide and test strategy with the prisoners (choices A and D) would require too many tests and prisoners. With 1000 bottles, you would need at least 100 prisoners to test 10 bottles each to cover all the bottles in one 24 hour period. And tasting for bitterness (choice D) wouldn't work since the poison's effect takes 24 hours.\n\nHaving all 10 prisoners sample all 1000 bottles (choice B) would determine the poisoned wine but kill all the prisoners, which is unethical and wasteful. \n\nThe optimal solution is to use a binary search strategy (choice C). Number the bottles 1 to 1000 and write each number in binary. This will take 10 binary digits (2^10 = 1024 which is greater than 1000). Assign each prisoner a digit position 1-10. For each bottle number, have the prisoner sip the wine if their digit is a 1 in that bottle's binary number. After 24 hours, line up the prisoners in their digit order. The binary number represented by the dead\/alive status of the prisoners will match the binary number of the poisoned bottle. This will definitively find the single poisoned bottle in just 24 hours with no more than 10 prisoners.\n\nSo in summary:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n\nThe binary search strategy is the fastest way to identify the single poisoned bottle out of 1000 bottles in 24 hours using only 10 prisoners.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
