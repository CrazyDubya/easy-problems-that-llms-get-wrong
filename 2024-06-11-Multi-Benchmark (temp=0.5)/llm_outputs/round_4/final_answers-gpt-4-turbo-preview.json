You initially pick one door out of three, giving you a 1\/3 chance of picking the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance of picking rotten vegetables.\n2. The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens another door that you didn't pick, revealing rotten vegetables. This is a crucial step because the host will always be able to do this due to the initial setup (two doors have rotten vegetables).\n3. Now, you're given the option to stay with your initial choice or switch to the other unopened door. Here's where the counterintuitive part comes in: switching doors actually gives you a 2\/3 chance of winning the gold bar, while sticking with your original choice leaves you with the initial 1\/3 chance.\n4. This is because your initial choice had a 1\/3 chance of being correct, and this probability doesn't change after the host opens a door with rotten vegetables. The probability that the gold bar is behind one of the two doors you didn't choose was 2\/3, and with one of those doors now shown to be a loser, that 2\/3 chance transfers to the remaining unchosen door.\n\nGiven your scenario, you initially chose door No. 1, and the host asks if you want to switch to door No. 2, but doesn't open any door to show where the rotten vegetables are. The question doesn't follow the exact steps of the Monty Hall problem because the host doesn't eliminate one of the losing options before offering the chance to switch. Without the step of the host revealing a door with rotten vegetables, all doors retain their original probabilities: 1\/3 for the gold bar and 2\/3 for rotten vegetables. Therefore, without additional information or actions taken by the host to change the conditions (like revealing a door with rotten vegetables), each door would still have an equal probability of containing the gold bar.\n\nSo, the answer, given the way the question is framed (without the host revealing a losing option before offering the switch), is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This means you have a 100% chance of hitting a bullet.\n\nIf you choose to spin:\n- By spinning, you're randomizing the positions of the bullets again.

The goat is safe from being eaten by the wolf, and the cabbage is safe because the wolf won't eat it. (1 crossing)\n\n2.

Since only two can cross at a time and they must share the torch, we have to strategize the crossings to minimize the total time. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **First Crossing:** A and B go together. Time taken = 2 minutes (since B is slower, we consider B's time). Now, A and B are across, but A will return with the torch.\n2. **A Returns:** Time taken = 1 minute. Now, A is back on the original side, and B is on the other side.\n3. **Second Crossing:** C and D go together. Time taken = 10 minutes (since D is slower, we consider D's time). Now, C and D are across, but one of them needs to return with the torch. It makes sense to send the faster of the two (C) back.\n4. **C Returns:** Time taken = 5 minutes. Now, C is back on the original side, and B and D are on the other side.\n5. **Final Crossing:** A and C go together. Time taken = 5 minutes (since C is slower, we consider C's time).\n\nAdding it all up: 2 (A and B cross) + 1 (A returns) + 10 (C and D cross) + 5 (C returns) + 5 (A and C cross) = 23 minutes.\n\nHowever, this approach isn't the most efficient. Let's consider another strategy:\n\n1. **First Crossing:** A and B go together. Time taken = 2 minutes. A and B are across.\n2. **A Returns:** Time taken = 1 minute. A is back.\n3. **Second Crossing:** C and D go together. Time taken = 10 minutes. C and D are across.\n4. **B Returns:** Time taken = 2 minutes. B is back because sending B back takes less time than sending C or D back.\n5. **Final Crossing:** A and B go together again.

You can achieve this by asking a question that is about the response of the other guardian. \n\nFor example, you could ask one of the guardians, \"If I asked the other guardian which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\" This question works because:\n- If you ask the truthful guardian, they will tell you what the lying guardian would say, which would be the door leading to death (since the liar would not tell you the correct door to freedom).\n- If you ask the lying guardian, they would lie about the truthful guardian's response, also indicating the door leading to death (since the truthful guardian would actually direct you to the door leading to freedom, but the liar would not truthfully relay that).\n\nIn both cases, the guardian you ask will point you to the door leading to death, so you would choose the opposite door.

Let's denote the distance to your friend's house as \\(D\\) miles. The time taken to reach your friend's house is \\(T_1 = \\frac{D}{3}\\) hours.\n\n3. **What we need to find**: The speed to run back, let's call it \\(V_{return}\\), such that the average speed of the entire trip is 6 mph (double of 3 mph).\n\n4. **Average speed for the entire trip**: The average speed is defined as the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance for the round trip is \\(2D\\) miles. We want this average speed to be 6 mph, so we set up the equation based on the definition of average speed: \\(\\frac{2D}{T_1 + T_2} = 6\\), where \\(T_2\\) is the time to run back.\n\n5. **Finding \\(T_2\\)**: \\(T_2\\) can be expressed as \\(T_2 = \\frac{D}{V_{return}}\\).\n\n6. **Substituting \\(T_1\\) and simplifying**: We substitute \\(T_1 = \\frac{D}{3}\\) into our average speed equation and solve for \\(V_{return}\\).\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2D}{\\frac{D}{3} + \\frac{D}{V_{return}}} = 6\n\\]\n\nSolving this equation:\n\n\\[\n2D = 6\\left(\\frac{D}{3} + \\frac{D}{V_{return}}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2D = 2D + 6\\frac{D}{V_{return}}\n\\]\n\nSince we want the average speed for the entire trip to be double the speed of going, which means the total time for the trip should be half the time it took to go at 3 mph. However, to actually achieve an average speed of 6 mph considering the time taken to walk to your friend's house at 3 mph, you would need to have no time spent on the return trip, which is impossible. \n\nThe mistake in the calculation above is assuming we can directly solve for \\(V_{return}\\) without recognizing that achieving an average speed of 6 mph, after walking at 3 mph for half the trip, would require instantaneous return or, in other words, an infinite speed, because any time spent on returning reduces the overall average speed below the target of 6 mph.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""}}
