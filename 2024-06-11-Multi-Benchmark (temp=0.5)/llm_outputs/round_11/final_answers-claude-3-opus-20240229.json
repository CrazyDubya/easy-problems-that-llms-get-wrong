Even if you raced all 6 at once, you would only know the winner of that race, not necessarily the overall fastest horse.\n\nTwo races also isn't enough. For example, if you split the horses into two groups of 3, the winners of those two races could be the 2nd and 3rd fastest overall. You wouldn't know which of those two was actually fastest.\n\nThree races is sufficient. Here's how:\n- Race all 6 horses in pairs (3 races of 2 horses each). \n- Take the 3 winners and race them against each other.\n- The winner of that race is the fastest overall.\n\nSo the minimum number of races needed to determine the fastest of 6 horses is three.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"2":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a gold bar; behind the others, rotten vegetables.

The key is that the host knows what's behind the doors and is intentionally asking you to switch to a specific door, No. 2. \n\nInitially, you had a 1\/3 chance of picking the correct door. The host then revealed that door No. 2 is not the winner, and is giving you the option to switch.\n\nIf you stick with your original choice of door No. 1, you still have only a 1\/3 chance of winning. But if you switch to door No. 3, you have a 2\/3 chance of winning, because the host's action of asking you to pick door No. 2 instead has given you additional information.\n\nBy offering you the specific choice of door No. 2, the host is in effect telling you that the gold bar is not behind door No. 2. Switching to the remaining unopened door, No. 3, gives you a 2\/3 probability of winning the gold bar.\n\nTherefore, the best strategy is to always switch doors when given the option by the host.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

By treating the prisoners as bits in a binary number, you can uniquely identify up to 2^10 (1024) bottles by having each prisoner drink from a specific subset of the bottles. For example, prisoner 1 drinks from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. Prisoner 2 drinks from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, etc. After 24 hours, seeing which prisoners have died will directly indicate the poisoned bottle, like bits in a binary number.

The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday decreases as the number of pairs increases.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for different numbers of pairs:\n\n- 1 pair (2 people): Probability of no shared birthdays = 1 (100%)\n- 23 pairs (46 people): Probability of no shared birthdays \u2248 0.0072 (0.72%)\n- 46 pairs (92 people): Probability of no shared birthdays \u2248 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000005 (extremely close to 0%)\n\nBased on these calculations, we can see that with 23 pairs of twins (46 people), the probability of no two people sharing the same birthday is already less than 1%.
