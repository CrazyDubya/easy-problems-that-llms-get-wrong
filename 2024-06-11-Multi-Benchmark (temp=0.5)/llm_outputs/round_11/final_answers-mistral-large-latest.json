Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy. This strategy is based on the concept of binary numbers, where each test can be considered a digit in a binary number, and each prisoner can be considered a bit.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000, which requires 10 digits (or bits). For example, the first bottle would be 0000000000, the second bottle would be 0000000001, and so on, up to the 1000th bottle, which would be 1111101000.\n\n2. Assign each prisoner to a specific digit (or bit) in the binary number. For example, the first prisoner would be assigned to the first digit, the second prisoner to the second digit, and so on.\n\n3. For each test, if a prisoner drinks from a bottle with a 1 in their assigned digit, then they will die if the poisoned bottle also has a 1 in that digit. If they drink from a bottle with a 0, they will survive regardless of whether the poisoned bottle has a 0 or 1 in that digit.\n\n4. After 24 hours, the king can look at which prisoners have died and which have survived, and use this information to determine the binary number of the poisoned bottle. For example, if the first, third, and seventh prisoners have died, then the poisoned bottle would have a binary number of 1010001000.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in a single day, using only 10 prisoners.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
