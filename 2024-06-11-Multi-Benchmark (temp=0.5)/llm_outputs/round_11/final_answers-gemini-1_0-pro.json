The winner of each pair advances to the next round until only one horse remains undefeated, declared the fastest. \n\n2. **Number of Races:** In a single-elimination tournament with N participants, the number of races required is always N-1.

Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.**\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n**1. Inefficiency of other options:**\n\n* **A. Getting all prisoners to sample each bottle:** This leads to the death of all prisoners except the one who drank the non-poisoned bottle, providing no information about the specific poisoned bottle.\n* **B. Dividing bottles equally and observing deaths:** This only identifies a single bottle as potentially poisoned, requiring further testing with the remaining prisoners.\n* **C. Noting the bitter taste:** This approach relies on the assumption that the poison has a distinct bitter taste, which may not always be the case. Additionally, relying solely on taste might lead to inaccurate identification.\n\n**2. Efficiency of the binary search strategy:**\n\n* This method assigns a unique binary code (using 0s and 1s) to each prisoner, representing a specific combination of wine bottles.\n* Each prisoner then tastes the wines corresponding to their assigned binary code.\n* After 24 hours, the king observes which prisoners are alive and which are dead.\n* Based on this information, the king can eliminate half of the remaining bottles by identifying the group that caused the deaths.\n* This process repeats with the remaining prisoners and bottles, further narrowing down the possibilities.\n* With each round of testing, the number of potential poisoned bottles is halved, allowing for efficient identification within the 24-hour timeframe.\n\n**Therefore, the answer is: {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}** \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
