Doubling this average would give me 6mph. However, since walking and running take the same amount of time (let's say one hour each way), the only way to achieve an average of 6mph for the whole trip is to run back at 9mph, which is the speed I would need to double the average. But, as the question specifies I need to run *back* twice as fast as my average speed for the whole trip, I would have to run at 12mph to account for the slower walk there.","score":""}}
