Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"```json\n{\n\"ANSWER\": \"D\",\n\"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the answer is D and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:**  The king needs to find *one* poisoned bottle out of 1000, and he only has time for each prisoner to consume wine once (since the poison takes 24 hours to kill).\n\n* **Why A, B, and C are incorrect:**\n    * **A:**  This would require each prisoner to drink from 1000 bottles, which is impossible.\n    * **B & C:**  Poison doesn't necessarily have a distinct taste. This method is unreliable and dangerous.\n\n* **Why D is correct (Binary Search):**\n\n    1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each bottle a number from 1 to 1000. Convert these numbers to their binary representation (e.g., Bottle 1 is 0000000001, Bottle 2 is 0000000010, Bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.).\n\n    2. **Prisoners as Bits:** Each prisoner represents a specific 'bit' position in the binary numbers. For example:\n       * Prisoner 1: Represents the ones place (rightmost digit)\n       * Prisoner 2: Represents the twos place \n       * Prisoner 3: Represents the fours place\n       * ... and so on.\n\n    3. **Giving Wine:** For each bottle, a prisoner drinks from it if their corresponding 'bit' position in the bottle's binary number is a '1'. \n       *  Example: Bottle 5 (binary 0000000101): Prisoners 1 and 3 would drink from this bottle.\n\n    4. **Decoding the Result:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who died represent '1' bits, and the living prisoners represent '0' bits.  Construct a binary number based on dead\/alive prisoners. This binary number directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\n* **Example:** Let's say Bottle 563 was poisoned. \n    * 563 in binary is 1000110011\n    * Prisoners 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9 would have drunk from this bottle and would die. \n    * The king would form the binary number 1000110011 (dead = 1, alive = 0), which converts back to 563, identifying the poisoned bottle.\n\n**This method is efficient because it can pinpoint one bottle out of 1000 with a maximum of 10 tests (2^10 = 1024).** \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is because we're looking at the probability of *any* two people sharing a birthday, not one specific person.\\n\\n**Twins and the Paradox:**  Each pair of twins guarantees a shared birthday.  Therefore, to have a greater than 50% chance of two people sharing a birthday, you only need enough twins to have 23 or more individuals in the room. Since each pair has 2 people, you would need 23 pairs \/ 2 people per pair = 11.5 pairs. Since you can't have half a pair, you need to round up to 12 pairs.\\n\\n**However, the answer choices only go up to 46 pairs. This implies that the question is actually asking about the general birthday paradox, and the mention of twins is irrelevant. Therefore, the closest answer is 23 pairs to get us to the minimum number of individuals needed for the paradox to hold.**\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
