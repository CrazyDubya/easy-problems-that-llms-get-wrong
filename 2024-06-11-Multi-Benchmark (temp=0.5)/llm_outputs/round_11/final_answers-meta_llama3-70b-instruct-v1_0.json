The key insight here is that the host's question is not just a random suggestion - the host knows what's behind each door, and will always reveal a rotten vegetable if I stick with my original choice.\n\nSo, if I switch to door No. 2, I effectively get to choose both doors No. 2 and No. 3, since the host would have revealed a rotten vegetable if I had chosen one of them initially. This means that the probability of the gold bar being behind door No. 2 (or No. 3) is now 2\/3, since I've effectively combined the probabilities of the two doors I didn't initially choose.\n\nTherefore, switching to door No. 2 (or No. 3) gives me a 2\/3 chance of winning, which is a bigger advantage than sticking with my original choice of door No. 1, which only has a 1\/3 chance of winning.\n\nMy answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This means that there are now 5 bullets remaining in the 5 remaining chambers.

The chamber that was just fired is definitely empty, and the other 5 chambers have a 5\/5 probability of containing a bullet.\n\nIf we don't spin the chambers again, the probability of the next chamber being empty is 1\/5, since there is only 1 empty chamber out of the 5 remaining chambers.

The key is to eliminate possibilities and gather information step by step.\n\nOption A is not necessary, as we can observe the bulbs in the same room.\n\nOption B, turning all switches on at once, doesn't provide any useful information, as we won't know which switch controls which bulb.\n\nOption C is a clever attempt, but it's based on a false assumption. Since the bulbs are LED, they don't get warm when turned on, so touching them won't give us any clues.\n\nOption D is the correct approach. By turning each switch on one at a time and observing the bulbs, we can determine which switch controls which bulb. Here's how:\n\n1. Turn switch A on and observe the bulbs. If one of them turns on, we know switch A controls that bulb.\n2. Turn switch A off and turn switch B on. If a different bulb turns on, we know switch B controls that bulb. If the same bulb turns on, we know switch B doesn't control it, and we can try switch C.\n3.

Since there are 1000 bottles of wine, we can represent each bottle as a binary number with 10 digits (2^10 = 1024, which is greater than 1000). We can then assign each prisoner a unique binary number, and have them drink from the bottles that correspond to their binary number.\n\nFor example, prisoner 1 can drink from bottles 1, 3, 5, ..., 999 (all bottles where the least significant bit is 1), prisoner 2 can drink from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, ..., 998, 999 (all bottles where the second least significant bit is 1), and so on.\n\nAfter 24 hours, the prisoners who die will indicate which bits are set in the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.

This is a great example of a counterintuitive probability puzzle.\n\nAt first glance, it might seem like we need a huge number of pairs of twins to reach a 50% chance of two people sharing the same birthday. But, surprisingly, the answer is much smaller than that.\n\nLet's think about it: if we have just one pair of twins, the probability that they share the same birthday is 1 (or 100%), since they're twins!\n\nNow, let's add more pairs of twins to the room. For each additional pair, the probability that at least one pair shares the same birthday increases. But how much does it increase?\n\nThe key insight here is that we're not asking about the probability that a specific pair of twins shares the same birthday, but rather that at least one pair out of all the pairs in the room shares the same birthday.\n\nUsing the complementary probability (i.e., the probability of the opposite event), we can calculate the probability that no two people in the room share the same birthday. Let's assume we have n pairs of twins in the room.\n\nThe probability that the first pair doesn't share the same birthday with anyone else is 364\/365 (since there are 365 possible birthdays, and we're excluding the birthday of the first twin).\n\nThe probability that the second pair doesn't share the same birthday with anyone else (including the first pair) is 363\/365, since we've already excluded one birthday.\n\nContinuing this logic, we can calculate the probability that no two people in the room share the same birthday:\n\n(364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n)\/365)\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest n such that this probability is less than or equal to 0.5 (i.e., a 50% chance that at least one pair shares the same birthday).\n\nUsing a calculator or computer to compute the values, we find that n = 23 pairs of twins is the smallest number that satisfies this condition.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
