For example:\n        * Prisoner 1: Drinks from every bottle where the *last* binary digit is a 1.\n        * Prisoner 2: Drinks from every bottle where the *second to last* binary digit is a 1.\n        * ...and so on.\n    * **Observe after 24 hours:**  The prisoners who die represent the '1' digits in the binary code of the poisoned bottle.  \n    * **Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary code of the poisoned bottle is 0010000001 (1 in positions 1, 4, and 5), which translates to bottle number 513.\n\n**This method works because each prisoner represents a specific digit in the binary representation of the bottle number. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles.** \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Therefore, we don't need to worry about the usual probability calculations of the birthday problem.\n\n* **Finding the Answer:**  To have at least a 50% chance, we need at least one guaranteed pair of matching birthdays.
