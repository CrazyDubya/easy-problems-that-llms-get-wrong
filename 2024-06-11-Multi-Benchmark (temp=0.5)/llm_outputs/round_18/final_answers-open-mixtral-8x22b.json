The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nC. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nD.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"C\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe best way to solve this problem is by using a binary search strategy. This method minimizes the number of tests needed and allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label the bottles from 1 to 1000.\n2. Divide the prisoners into 10 groups, with each group consisting of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512 prisoners, respectively.\n3. Number the groups from 0 to 9.\n4. Assign each group a bottle to test, where the bottle number corresponds to the binary representation of the group number. For example, group 0 (1 prisoner) will test bottle 1, group 1 (2 prisoners) will test bottles 2 and 3, group 2 (4 prisoners) will test bottles 4, 5, 6, and 7, and so on.\n5. After the prisoners have consumed the wine, wait for 24 hours to see who dies.\n6. Based on the group number of the deceased prisoner(s), determine the poisoned bottle. The position of the poisoned bottle within the group can be further narrowed down using the same binary search strategy.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing, making it the fastest and most efficient way to solve the problem.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
