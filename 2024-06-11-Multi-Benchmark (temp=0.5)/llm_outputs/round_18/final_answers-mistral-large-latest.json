The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nC.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy. This strategy allows him to test multiple bottles at once and eliminate large portions of the wine in a single test.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nThe king can label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000 (which requires 10 digits). Each digit corresponds to one of the 10 prisoners. If the digit is 1, the prisoner drinks from the bottle; if the digit is 0, the prisoner does not drink from the bottle.\n\nFor example, if the poisoned bottle is labeled 0101010101, the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th prisoners will drink from it, and the rest will not. After 24 hours, the king will know which prisoners have died, and can use this information to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one day, making it the fastest way.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
