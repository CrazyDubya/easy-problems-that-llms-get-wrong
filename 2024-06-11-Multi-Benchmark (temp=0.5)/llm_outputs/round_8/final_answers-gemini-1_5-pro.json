Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"Here's the breakdown of why the correct answer is **C**, along with explanations for the other options:\n\n**The Best Solution (C):**\n\nThe most efficient way to solve this classic puzzle is using a binary search strategy:\n\n1. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n2. **Number the Bottles:**  Imagine each bottle has a binary number assigned (1 to 1000, which can be represented with up to 10 digits in binary).\n3. **Prepare the Samples:** On the first day, each prisoner drinks from bottles based on their corresponding binary digit. For example:\n    * Prisoner 1 drinks from every bottle where the bottle's binary representation has a '1' in the units place (1, 3, 5, 7...).\n    * Prisoner 2 drinks from every bottle where the bottle's binary representation has a '1' in the twos place (2, 3, 6, 7...). \n    * Continue this pattern for all 10 prisoners.\n4. **Observe After 24 Hours:**  Note which prisoners die. If a prisoner dies, it means the poisoned bottle's binary representation has a '1' in their corresponding digit position.\n5. **Construct the Binary Number:**  Create a binary number based on the dead\/alive status of the prisoners. For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0110000001, which converts to 769. Therefore, bottle 769 is poisoned.\n\n**Why Binary Search Works:** Binary search is incredibly efficient. With each test, you eliminate half of the remaining possibilities. This allows you to test a large number of items (1000 bottles) with a surprisingly small number of tests (10 prisoners).\n\n**Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n\n* **A:** This method is highly inefficient and would result in the death of all prisoners.\n* **B:**  With 1000 bottles, you can't guarantee each prisoner gets a unique bottle, making it impossible to pinpoint the poisoned one.\n* **D:** The problem states the poison takes 24 hours to take effect. Tasting it wouldn't provide immediate results.\n\n**JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

While this is less than the classic birthday paradox threshold, the fact that we have guaranteed pairs significantly increases the probability of a shared birthday between people from *different* twin pairs. The odds of two people NOT sharing a birthday from different pairs decrease rapidly with each additional pair.\n\n**Therefore, 12 pairs of twins (24 people) is a reasonable estimate to have at least a 50% chance of two people (not twins themselves) sharing the same birthday.**\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
