Here's the breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1. Initially, you pick one of the three doors. Let's say you pick Door No. 1.\n2. The host, who knows what is behind each door, then offers you the chance to switch to Door No. 2. It's important to note that the host's offer to switch is not random; it is based on the knowledge of what is behind each door.\n\nAccording to the Monty Hall problem, the optimal strategy is to always switch doors. Here's why:\n\n- When you first choose a door (Door No. 1), there is a 1\/3 chance that the gold bar is behind that door and a 2\/3 chance that it is behind one of the other two doors.\n- When the host offers you the chance to switch, he is effectively providing you with additional information. Since the host knows where the gold bar is, his offer to switch is designed to increase your chances of winning if you switch.\n- By switching, you are now leveraging the 2\/3 probability that the gold bar is behind one of the other two doors.\n\nIn summary, switching doors gives you a 2\/3 chance of winning the gold bar, while sticking with your original choice gives you only a 1\/3 chance.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to switch to Door No. 2.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"To solve the problem of identifying the poisoned bottle of wine using the 10 prisoners in the fastest way, we need to leverage the concept of binary numbers. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle of wine can be represented by a unique binary number from 0 to 999 (since there are 1000 bottles). This requires 10 bits (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) which is enough to cover all 1000 bottles).\n\n2. **Assigning Bottles to Prisoners**: Each prisoner will represent one bit in the binary number. For example:\n   - Prisoner 1 represents the least significant bit (2^0),\n   - Prisoner 2 represents the next bit (2^1),\n   - and so on up to Prisoner 10 who represents the most significant bit (2^9).\n\n3. **Testing Strategy**: Each bottle is assigned a binary number. If a bit in the binary number is 1, the corresponding prisoner will take a sip from that bottle. For example, if bottle number 5 (which is 0000000101 in binary) is to be tested, Prisoner 1 and Prisoner 3 will take a sip from it (since the binary representation has 1s in the positions corresponding to these prisoners).\n\n4. **Identifying the Poisoned Bottle**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number corresponds to the poisoned bottle. For example, if Prisoner 1 and Prisoner 3 die, the binary number is 0000000101, which translates to bottle number 5.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours using a systematic and efficient approach.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The mass of the tree increases by 1kg (from 2kg to 3kg). \n\nHowever, the problem does not specify that the tree's growth directly consumes the soil's mass. In reality, trees grow by absorbing nutrients and water from the soil, but the mass of the soil itself does not decrease significantly in such a straightforward manner. The soil primarily loses nutrients and water, which are not accounted for in the mass given in the problem.\n\nGiven the lack of information about soil mass loss due to tree growth, we assume the soil mass remains unchanged.\n\nThus, the mass of the soil remains the same at 10kg.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"29":{"category":"Relational","question":"A man steps over a 0.5m hurdle.
