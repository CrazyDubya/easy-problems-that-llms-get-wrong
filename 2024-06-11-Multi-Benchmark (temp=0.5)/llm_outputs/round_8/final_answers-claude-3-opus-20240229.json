The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine.

A binary search strategy is optimal.\n\nWith 10 prisoners, you can represent 1024 (2^10) different states using binary numbers, where each prisoner represents a bit. For example:\n- Prisoner 1 samples every other bottle (1, 3, 5, 7, ...)\n- Prisoner 2 samples every 4th bottle starting with the 2nd (2, 6, 10, 14, ...)  \n- Prisoner 3 samples every 8th bottle starting with the 4th (4, 12, 20, 28, ...)\nAnd so on...\n\nAfter 24 hours, look at which prisoners have died. The positions of the dead prisoners will form a 10-bit binary number that uniquely identifies the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 10 died, that forms the binary number 1000100001, or bottle number 545.\n\nThis requires only 1 round of testing and is guaranteed to identify the single poisoned bottle out of 1000 total.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
