Since the host knows what's behind each door, when they ask you if you want to switch to door No. 2, they're essentially giving you new information.\n\nIf the gold bar were behind door No. 1, the host would still ask you to switch to door No. 2, since they want to give you the opportunity to switch away from the gold bar.

This is more than enough to cover the 1000 bottles of wine.\n\nHere's how the king can do it:\n\n1. Label each prisoner with a unique binary number from 0 to 9 (e.g., 0000000000 to 1000000000).\n2.

The poisoned bottle is the one that corresponds to the decimal number that is the intersection of all the dead prisoners' labels.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 5 die, their binary labels are 0000000001, 0000000011, and 0000010101, respectively.

When we add a second person, the probability that this person has a different birthday than the first person is 364\/365, since there's one fewer day to choose from. The probability that both people have different birthdays is then (1\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365).\n\nAs we continue adding people to the room, the probability that all of them have different birthdays decreases. When we reach 23 people, the probability that all of them have different birthdays is less than 50%. This means that the probability that at least two people share a birthday is greater than 50%.\n\nHere's a rough calculation to illustrate this:\n\n* 1 person: 1\/365\n* 2 people: (1\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u2248 0.997\n* 3 people: (1\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u2248 0.992\n* ...\n* 23 people: (1\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 (343\/365) \u2248 0.493\n\nSince we need at least 23 people for the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday to exceed 50%, we don't need 23 pairs of twins.
