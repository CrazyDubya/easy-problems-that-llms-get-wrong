If we race all 6 horses together in one race, we can only determine the fastest horse, but not the relative speeds of the other horses.\n2. If we race 3 horses at a time, we can find the fastest horse in each group of 3, but we still can't determine the overall fastest horse.\n3. However, if we race 2 horses at a time, we can create a tournament-style competition. We can race horses A and B, then C and D, then E and F. The winners of each race can then race each other, and the winner of that race can race the winner of the previous race to determine the overall fastest horse.\n\nWith this approach, we need a minimum of 5 races: 3 races to determine the winners of each pair, 1 race to determine the winner of the three winners, and 1 final race to determine the overall fastest horse.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not among the options provided.

The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption, so the king can't simply divide the bottles among the prisoners and wait for one to die.\n\nThe correct approach is to use a binary search strategy, which is option D. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle of wine with a binary number from 0 to 999 (since there are 1000 bottles).\n2. Divide the 10 prisoners into two groups of 5.\n3. For each group, have them drink a mixture of wine from bottles with a 0 in a specific binary position (e.g., the first group drinks a mixture of wine from bottles with a 0 in the most significant bit, the second group drinks a mixture of wine from bottles with a 0 in the second most significant bit, and so on).\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners die. The binary positions that correspond to the dead prisoners will indicate the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n5. Since there are 10 prisoners, the king can test 10 binary positions in parallel, which means he can identify the poisoned bottle in a single 24-hour period.\n\nThis strategy is the fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle, as it minimizes the number of tests needed and takes advantage of the 24-hour window.\n\nHere's the answer in JSON format:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

To calculate this probability, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability that all people have different birthdays. Then, we can subtract this probability from 1 to get the probability that at least two people share a birthday.\n\nUsing this approach, we can calculate the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday for different numbers of people in the room:\n\n* 2 people: 1 - (365\/365) \\* (364\/365) = 1\/365\n* 3 people: 1 - (365\/365) \\* (364\/365) \\* (363\/365) \u2248 0.0024\n* 4 people: 1 - (365\/365) \\* (364\/365) \\* (363\/365) \\* (362\/365) \u2248 0.0163\n* ...\n* 23 people: 1 - (365\/365) \\* (364\/365) \\* ... \\* (343\/365) \u2248 0.507\n\nAs we can see, with 23 people in the room, the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is greater than 50%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
