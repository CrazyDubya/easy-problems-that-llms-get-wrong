Convert each bottle's number into its binary equivalent.  Each prisoner drinks from the bottles where their corresponding binary place value is a '1'.\n\n    3. **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, the dead prisoners represent '1' bits, and the living prisoners represent '0' bits. Construct a binary number based on this. This binary number, when converted to decimal, will be the number of the poisoned bottle.\n\n* **Example:** Let's say bottle number 5 is poisoned.\n\n    * Binary of 5: 0000000101\n    * Prisoners 1 and 3 would drink from bottle #5.\n    * After 24 hours, only prisoners 1 and 3 would be dead.\n    * The king would read the 'dead' prisoners as '1' and 'alive' as '0': 0000000101 \n    * This binary number converts back to decimal 5, identifying the poisoned bottle.\n\n* **Efficiency:** This method guarantees finding the poisoned bottle with the death of at most a few prisoners, making it the fastest and most efficient solution.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Therefore, we need enough twins to have approximately 23 people in the room to reach that >50% probability.\n\n* **Calculation:** Since each pair of twins represents two people, we need approximately 23 \/ 2 = 11.5 pairs. Since we can't have half a pair, we round up to 12 pairs. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of twin *pairs* for at least a 50% chance.  With 12 pairs of twins (24 people total), the probability is well over 50%.  Therefore, the closest answer to ensuring at least a 50% chance is **23 pairs of twins**.
