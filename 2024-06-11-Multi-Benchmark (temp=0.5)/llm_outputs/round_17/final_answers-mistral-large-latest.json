Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"The fastest way to identify the poisoned bottle is not by dividing the bottles among the prisoners and waiting for someone to die or taste a bitter wine, as these methods do not leverage the 24-hour time frame and the number of prisoners effectively. Instead, using a binary search strategy allows the king to test multiple bottles simultaneously while minimizing the number of tests needed.\n\nIn this strategy, the king can label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000 (10 bits are needed since 2^10 = 1024, which is just above 1000). Then, assign each of the 10 prisoners to represent one of the 10 bits. For each prisoner, prepare a mixture of sips from all the bottles that have a '1' in the corresponding bit position. After 24 hours, the king will know which prisoners have consumed the poison, and by looking at their corresponding bit positions, he can determine the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 8 die, the poisoned bottle would have a binary number of 1000 in the first, fourth, and eighth positions, which corresponds to the decimal number 8 (since 2^0 + 2^3 + 2^7 = 8).\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
