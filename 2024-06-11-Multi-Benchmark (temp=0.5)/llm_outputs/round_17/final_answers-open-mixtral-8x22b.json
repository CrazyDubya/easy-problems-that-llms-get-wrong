Initially, the probability of each door having the gold bar is equal (1\/3). However, after the host opens one door (say door No. 3) and reveals rotten vegetables, the probability distribution changes. Now, the probability of door No. 1 having the gold bar remains the same (1\/3), but the probability of door No. 2 having the gold bar increases to 2\/3. This is because the host's action of opening door No. 3 effectively transfers the probability of the gold bar being behind that door to the remaining unopened door (door No. 2). Therefore, switching to door No. 2 gives the biggest advantage.","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This method minimizes the number of tests needed and allows the king to know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n- Divide the bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n- Each prisoner tastes one bottle from each group (total of 10 bottles per prisoner).\n- Wait for 24 hours. If a prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in the corresponding group. If no one dies, then the poisoned bottle is in the remaining group.\n- Repeat the process with the remaining group of 100 bottles, dividing them into 10 groups of 10 bottles each.\n- Each prisoner tastes one bottle from each group (total of 10 bottles per prisoner).\n- Wait for 24 hours. If a prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in the corresponding group. If no one dies, then the poisoned bottle is in the remaining group.\n- Repeat the process with the remaining group of 10 bottles, dividing them into 10 groups of 1 bottle each.\n- Each prisoner tastes one bottle (total of 1 bottle per prisoner).\n- Wait for 24 hours. If a prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is the one they drank from. If no one dies, then the poisoned bottle is not in the remaining group.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time possible, while minimizing the number of prisoners needed to test the wine.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

However, this question is asking about pairs of twins, which means we are dealing with a smaller set of possible birthdays (365 days in a year divided by 2 since twins share the same birthday).\n\nLet's calculate the probability of having at least one pair of twins with the same birthday in a room with n pairs of twins. The probability of any two pairs of twins not having the same birthday is (365-1)\/365. The probability of n pairs of twins not having the same birthday is ((365-1)\/365)^(n-1) because the first pair establishes a birthday, and we are looking for any subsequent pairs that match that birthday.\n\nWe want to find the smallest n such that the probability of at least one pair of twins having the same birthday is greater than or equal to 50%. This means we want the probability of no pairs having the same birthday to be less than or equal to 50%.\n\nLet's calculate this probability for each option:\n\nA. 1 pair: The probability is 1 (since there is only 1 pair, there is no chance of a match).\nB. 12 pairs: The probability is ((365-1)\/365)^11 \u2248 0.969\nC. 46 pairs: The probability is ((365-1)\/365)^45 \u2248 0.458\nD. 23 pairs: The probability is ((365-1)\/365)^22 \u2248 0.524\n\nSince we are looking for a probability less than or equal to 50%, the correct answer is D. 23 pairs of twins.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
