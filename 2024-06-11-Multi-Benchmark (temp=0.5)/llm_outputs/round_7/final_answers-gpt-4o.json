Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Choice**: You pick Door No. 1.\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, offers you to switch to Door No. 2. This implies that the host has revealed some information indirectly.\n\nIn the Monty Hall problem, the host always offers the chance to switch after revealing a door that does not have the prize. In this case, the host did not explicitly reveal a door, but the offer to switch suggests that switching is beneficial.\n\n**Probability Analysis**:\n- Initially, the probability of the gold bar being behind Door No. 1 is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n- The probability of the gold bar being behind either Door No. 2 or Door No. 3 is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nWhen the host offers you to switch to Door No. 2, he is essentially guiding you towards the higher probability option. Given that the host knows the location of the gold bar, the offer to switch increases your chances of winning if you switch.\n\nThus, switching to Door No. 2 gives you a higher probability of winning the gold bar.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to switch to Door No. 2.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the properties of the guardians and doors:**\n   - One guardian always tells the truth and guards the death door.\n   - The other guardian always lies and guards the freedom door.\n\n2. **Formulate the strategy:**\n   - Since one guardian always lies and the other always tells the truth, we can use a question that accounts for both scenarios simultaneously.\n\n3. **Determine the effective question:**\n   - You can ask either guardian the following question: \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would he point to?\"\n   - Explanation:\n     - If you ask the truth-teller, he knows the liar would point to the death door, so the truth-teller will point to the death door too.\n     - If you ask the liar, he knows the truth-teller would point to the death door, but since he lies, he will point to the freedom door.\n   - In both cases, the answer you get will be the door that leads to death. Therefore, you should choose the opposite door to the one indicated.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - You only need to ask one question to determine the correct door.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of questions needed is one.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

Given that we have 10 prisoners, the most efficient way to determine the poisoned bottle is by using a binary representation strategy.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n1. We have 1000 bottles, which can be represented in binary form using 10 bits (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\), which is more than 1000).\n2. Assign each bottle a unique binary number from 0 to 999.\n3. Each prisoner will be assigned a bit position (from the 10-bit binary representation).\n4. If a particular bit in the binary representation of a bottle's number is 1, the corresponding prisoner will drink from that bottle. If it is 0, the prisoner will not drink from that bottle.\n5. After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will correspond to the bottle number that contains the poison.\n\nFor example, if bottle 5 (binary 0000000101) is poisoned, prisoners 1 and 3 (representing the 2^0 and 2^2 positions) will die, indicating the binary number 0000000101, which is 5 in decimal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"To solve this problem, let's denote the distance to your friend's house as \\( d \\) miles. The time it takes to walk to your friend's house at an average speed of 3 mph is:\n\n\\[ t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThe total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\) miles. To double the average speed for the entire trip, the average speed must be:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 3 \\text{ mph} = 6 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nThe total time for the round trip at this average speed would be:\n\n\\[ t_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{2d}{6} = \\frac{d}{3} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSince the time to walk to your friend's house is already \\( \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours, there is no time left for the return trip. Therefore, to achieve an average speed of 6 mph for the entire trip, you would need to return in zero time, which is physically impossible. Hence, you would need to run back infinitely fast.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""}}
