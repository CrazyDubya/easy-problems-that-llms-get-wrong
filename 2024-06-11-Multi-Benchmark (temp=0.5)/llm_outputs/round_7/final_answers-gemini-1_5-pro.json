Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"C\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is C and how it works:\n\n* **A is incorrect** because the poison is tasteless, only taking effect after 24 hours.\n* **B is incorrect** as it would require each prisoner to drink from 1000 bottles, leading to certain death for all.\n* **D is incorrect** as it still leads to the death of all prisoners involved in the testing.\n\n**C is the correct answer** because it utilizes the efficiency of a binary search:\n\n1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10. Convert each prisoner's number to its binary equivalent (e.g., Prisoner 1 is 001, Prisoner 2 is 010, Prisoner 3 is 011, etc.).  Each digit in the binary number represents a specific group of bottles.\n2. **Assigning Bottles:**  Divide the bottles into groups based on their binary representation. For example:\n    * Prisoner 1 (001) drinks from every bottle where the *last* binary digit is a 1.\n    * Prisoner 2 (010) drinks from every bottle where the *second to last* binary digit is a 1.\n    * Prisoner 3 (011) drinks from every bottle where the *last* OR *second to last* binary digit is a 1... and so on.\n3. **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died. Construct a binary number where '1' represents a dead prisoner and '0' a living one. This binary number directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle number. \n\n**Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 011001, which translates to bottle number 25.\n\n**Why this works:** Binary search is highly efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles, covering the entire set of 1000.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
