The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nC. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nD.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy. This strategy allows him to test multiple bottles at once, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000, which requires 10 digits (as 2^10 = 1024). For example, the first bottle would be 0000000000, the second 0000000001, and so on.\n2. Assign each digit position to a different prisoner. So, prisoner 1 gets the first digit, prisoner 2 the second, and so on.\n3. If the digit in a bottle's label is 1, the corresponding prisoner drinks from that bottle. If it's 0, they don't.\n4. After 24 hours, the king checks which prisoners have died. The binary number formed by their positions will correspond to the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 2, and 8 die, the poisoned bottle would be 1100000000 in binary, or 2048 in decimal.\n\nThis method allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours, as he only needs to wait for the poison to take effect.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is also known as a pangrammatic sentence.
