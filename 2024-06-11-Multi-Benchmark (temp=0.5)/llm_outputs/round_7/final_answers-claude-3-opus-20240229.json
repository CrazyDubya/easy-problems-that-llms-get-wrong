The king can number the bottles from 1 to 1000 and represent each number in binary format, which will require at most 10 bits (2^10 = 1024). Each prisoner is assigned to a bit position. For each bottle number, a prisoner takes a sip if their assigned bit is 1 in that bottle's binary representation. After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank the poison will have died. By looking at which prisoners died, the king can determine the binary representation of the poisoned bottle's number. This allows testing 1000 bottles with just 10 prisoners in only 24 hours.\",\n  \"ANSWER\": \"C\"\n}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
