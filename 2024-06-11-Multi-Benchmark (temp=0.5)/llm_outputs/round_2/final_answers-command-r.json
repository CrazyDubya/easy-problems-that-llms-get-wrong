We want to use the jugs to measure 4 gallons of water, which cannot be achieved using only one of the jugs. \n\nThe closest we can get to 4 gallons is using the 4-gallon jug, but we can also achieve 3 gallons with the 3-gallon jug. We can fill the 3-gallon jug, and then transfer the water into the 4-gallon jug, which will hold 3 gallons of water. At this point, we have 1 gallon left to measure out. \n\nTo get the remaining 1 gallon, we can use the 5-gallon jug to hold 2 gallons of water, leaving 3 gallons in the 4-gallon jug. Pouring the 2 gallons from the 5-gallon jug into the 3-gallon jug will leave 1 gallon in the former, which can then be poured into the 4-gallon jug to reach the desired 4 gallons. \n\nWhile this method does involve some back-and-forth, it is efficient in that it does not require any guess-and-check measurements, and uses a clear, logical progression of steps.","score":""},"28":{"category":"Popular science","question":"A 2kg tree grows in a planted pot with 10kg of soil.
