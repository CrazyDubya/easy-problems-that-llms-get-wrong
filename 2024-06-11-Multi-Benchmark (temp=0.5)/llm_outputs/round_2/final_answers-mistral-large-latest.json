Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe most efficient way to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number that is 10 digits long (since we have 10 prisoners). This can represent numbers from 0 to 1023, which is more than enough for our 1000 bottles.\n\n2. For each prisoner, assign them a specific digit in the binary number (1 through 10).\n\n3. If the digit for a prisoner is a 1 in a bottle's binary number, have that prisoner drink from that bottle.\n\n4. After 24 hours, any prisoner who is still alive will have a 0 for their digit in the binary number of the poisoned bottle. Any prisoner who has died will have a 1 for their digit.\n\n5. By reading the binary number formed by the live\/dead status of the prisoners, the king can identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours, making it the fastest way. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they would either not identify the poisoned bottle (B), take more than 24 hours (C), or kill all the prisoners (D).","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
