Here's how to approach it:\n\n* **The Birthday Paradox:**  The basic birthday paradox states that you only need 23 people in a room to have a greater than 50% chance of two people sharing a birthday. This is because we're looking at the probability of *any* two people sharing a birthday, not just one specific person matching another.\n\n* **Twins and the Paradox:** With twins, we're essentially guaranteeing a birthday match within each pair.  However, we still need to consider the probability of someone from one twin pair sharing a birthday with someone from a *different* twin pair to reach the 50% threshold.\n\n* **Finding the Number:**  While not exact, we can approximate the solution. Since the original paradox requires 23 unique birthdays for a high probability of a match, we can think of each twin pair as representing one 'unique' birthday.  Therefore, we would need approximately 23 pairs of twins to have a greater than 50% chance of two people from *different* pairs sharing a birthday. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
