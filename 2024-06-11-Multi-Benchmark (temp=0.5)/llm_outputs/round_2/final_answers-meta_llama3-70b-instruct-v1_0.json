Since the bulbs are LED and don't get warm when turned on, we can't use temperature to determine which switch controls which bulb.\n\nThe best approach is to turn each switch on one at a time and observe the bulbs. This way, we can see which bulb turns on with each switch, and we can eliminate possibilities one by one.\n\nFor example, if we turn switch A on and the red bulb turns on, we know that switch A controls the red bulb.

We can't simply divide the bottles among the prisoners, as options B and D suggest, because we wouldn't be able to pinpoint the exact poisoned bottle.\n\nOption C is also not the best approach, as it would take 24 hours to identify the poisoned bottle, but we wouldn't know which specific bottle was poisoned.\n\nThe most efficient approach is to use a binary search strategy, as option A suggests. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a binary number from 0 to 999 (since there are 1000 bottles).\n2. Divide the prisoners into two groups: one group will test the bottles with a 0 in the most significant bit (MSB) position, and the other group will test the bottles with a 1 in the MSB position.\n3. After 24 hours, see which group has prisoners who died. If the group with 0 in the MSB position died, then the poisoned bottle has a 0 in the MSB position. Otherwise, it has a 1.\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 for the next most significant bit, and so on, until you've narrowed down the possibilities to a single bottle.\n\nUsing this strategy, we can identify the poisoned bottle in just 10 tests (since 2^10 = 1024, which is greater than 1000).

For each additional pair, the probability of at least one pair sharing the same birthday increases. But how fast does it increase?\n\nThe key insight here is that we're not looking for the probability of a specific pair sharing the same birthday, but rather the probability of at least one pair sharing the same birthday.\n\nUsing the complementary probability approach, we can calculate the probability of no pairs sharing the same birthday and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability of at least one pair sharing the same birthday.\n\nAfter some calculations (or using a probability table), we find that with 23 pairs of twins (46 people), the probability of at least one pair sharing the same birthday is approximately 50.7%.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
