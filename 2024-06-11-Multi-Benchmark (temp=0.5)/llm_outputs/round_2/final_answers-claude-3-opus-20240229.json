The king can number the bottles from 1 to 1000 and represent each number in binary using the 10 prisoners. For example, bottle 1 would be represented as 0000000001, with each prisoner assigned to a specific digit (1st prisoner is the 1's place, 2nd prisoner is the 2's place, etc.). Each prisoner samples the wine from the bottles corresponding to a 1 in their assigned digit. After 24 hours, the prisoners who sampled the poisoned wine will have died. By looking at which prisoners died, the king can determine the binary representation of the poisoned bottle's number. This allows testing 1000 bottles with just 10 prisoners in only 24 hours.\",\n  \"ANSWER\": \"A\"\n}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
