This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Give each prisoner one bottle from each group to drink.\n3. Wait for 24 hours.\n4. If a prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that the prisoner drank from. If no prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in the remaining group.\n5. Repeat this process with the remaining bottles until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nUsing this strategy, the king can identify the poisoned bottle in just 10 tests, which is the best possible outcome given that he has 10 prisoners.\n\nOption B is not feasible because it would require each prisoner to drink 1000 bottles of wine, which is not possible in 24 hours. Option C is not feasible because the poison is bitter, but the prisoners may not be able to detect it. Option D is not feasible because it would require the prisoners to die, which is not a humane solution.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
