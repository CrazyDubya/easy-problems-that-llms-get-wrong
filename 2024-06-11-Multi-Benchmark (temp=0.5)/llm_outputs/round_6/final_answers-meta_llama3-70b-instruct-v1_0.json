We can divide them into three groups of two horses each: (A, B), (C, D), and (E, F). We race each group, and the winner of each group moves on to the next round. This takes three races.\n\nIn the next round, we have three horses left: the winners of each group. We can race two of them, and the winner of that race moves on to the final round. This takes one more race.\n\nIn the final round, we have two horses left, and we race them to determine the fastest horse. This takes one more race.\n\nIn total, we need 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 races to determine the fastest horse. However, the question asks for the minimum number of races, and we can actually do it in three races.\n\nHere's how: we race all six horses at once, and the horse that comes in last is eliminated. Then, we race the remaining five horses, and the horse that comes in last is eliminated again. Finally, we race the remaining four horses, and the horse that comes in first is the fastest horse.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"2":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a gold bar; behind the others, rotten vegetables.

Let's think about it step by step:\n\n1. If we ask a question to one of the guardians, we can't be sure if the answer is true or false.\n2. However, if we ask a question that forces the guardian to reveal the truth, we can make an informed decision.\n\nHere's the key insight: we can ask a question that is independent of the door the guardian is guarding. For example, we can ask a guardian, \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\nThink about it:\n\n* If the guardian we ask is the truth-teller, they will tell us what the liar would say, which would be the wrong door.\n* If the guardian we ask is the liar, they will lie about what the truth-teller would say, which would also be the wrong door.\n\nSo, regardless of who we ask, the answer will always steer us away from the death door. We can then safely choose the other door.\n\nThis approach requires only one question, making the correct answer:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

Option B is not feasible because it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is impractical. Options C and D are also not viable because the poison takes effect 24 hours after consumption, so tasting or sipping the wine wouldn't provide immediate results.\n\nThe correct approach is to use a binary search strategy, which is option A. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Assign each prisoner a unique binary number from 0 to 9 (e.g., 0000000000 to 1000000000).\n2. Label each bottle of wine with a binary number from 1 to 1000 (e.g., 0000000001 to 1111101000).\n3. For each prisoner, have them drink from the bottles that correspond to a \"1\" in their binary number.\n4. Wait 24 hours and observe which prisoners die.\n5. Use the binary numbers to deduce which bottle of wine is poisoned.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 9 die, the poisoned bottle would be the one with the binary label 1010000001 (1 + 4 + 256 = 261).\n\nThis approach ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle in just 24 hours using only 10 prisoners.\n\nHere's the answer in JSON format:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
