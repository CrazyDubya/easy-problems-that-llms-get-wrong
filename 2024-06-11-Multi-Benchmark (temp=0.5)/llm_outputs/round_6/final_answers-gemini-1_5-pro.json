Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"```json\n{\n\"ANSWER\": \"A\",\n\"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is A and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:** The king needs to find a single poisoned bottle out of 1000, and he only has one chance to test (due to the 24-hour delay).\n\n* **Why A (Binary Search) is the Solution:**\n\n    * **Efficiency:** Binary search is the most efficient way to search a sorted set of data.  While the bottles aren't literally 'sorted', we can treat them as such for our testing purposes.\n    * **How it Works:**\n        1. **Number the Bottles:** Assign each bottle a number from 1 to 1000.\n        2. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n        3. **Binary Representation:**  Think of each prisoner as representing a 'digit' in a binary number (10 prisoners can represent numbers up to 1023, which is enough for 1000 bottles).\n        4. **Assign Wine:**  For each bottle, give a sip to the prisoners whose number corresponds to a '1' in the binary representation of the bottle's number. \n            * Example: Bottle #5 (binary 0000000101) would be sipped by Prisoner #1 and Prisoner #3.\n        5. **Observe After 24 Hours:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die.  The binary representation of the poisoned bottle number will be formed by noting which prisoners died.  For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0000010101, which translates to bottle #21.\n\n* **Why Other Options are Incorrect:**\n\n    * **B:**  This is highly inefficient and doesn't take advantage of the 24-hour delay to gain information.\n    * **C:** The poison is tasteless, only detectable by its deadly effect after 24 hours.\n    * **D:** Similar to B, this is inefficient and doesn't leverage the time delay or the number of prisoners effectively. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
