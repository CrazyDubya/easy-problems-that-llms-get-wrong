The torch adds a constraint that means only one person can cross the bridge at a time.\n\nThe best strategy would be to send the fastest person across first. This gets the fastest person across the bridge in the shortest time, which is 1 minute for person A. Then, person A could return with the torch and accompany the second fastest person (B), who takes 2 minutes to cross the bridge. Meanwhile, the other two people could wait on the starting side of the bridge. This strategy would ensure that the two slowest people don't hold up the entire operation. \n\nHowever, the question doesn't state how long it takes for the torch bearer to return across the bridge. If we assume the return trip is instant, then the total time taken using the above strategy is 3 minutes: 1 minute for A, and 2 minutes for B. But if we factor in the return time for A, then the time increases, and it's no longer the definitive fastest strategy.\n\nWe also don't know if there are any constraints preventing some people from crossing together, such as whether the bridge is wide enough for multiple people at once. If it's wide enough, then two people could cross at the same time, which would further decrease the total time.\n\nTherefore, there is not enough information to determine the definitive fastest time, and I select **C** as the answer.","score":""},"15":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You're in a room with two doors that lead out.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n\nThere are 366 possible birthdays, considering leap years. To find the probability that two people in a room have the same birthday, we use the formula for the combination:\n\nn-r\\over r\n\nIn this case, n is 366 and r is the number of people in the room. We want to find the lowest number of people such that the probability is greater than 50% or 0.5.\n\n366-1\\over 1 = 365\n366-2\\over 2 = 133469 > 0.5\n\nWe're looking for the lowest number, so we'll start from the second option. Each additional pair of twins introduces two people into the room. 1 pair of twins gives us a probability of 1\/2 * 1\/2 = 1\/4, 2 pairs give us 3\/4 * 1\/4 = 1\/2, 3 pairs give us 5\/8 * 1\/8 = 19\/64, and so on.\n\nWe can notice that each additional pair increases the probability by a factor of 1\/2. Starting from 1\/2, we need to double the probability three times to pass the 50% threshold. This translates to four pairs of twins. Four pairs of twins plus one pair of twins (the initial two people) equals 46 pairs of twins.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
