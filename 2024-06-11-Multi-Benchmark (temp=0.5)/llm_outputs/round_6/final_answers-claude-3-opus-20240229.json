The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"Here is my analysis of the answers:\n\nA. This is the correct answer. Using a binary search strategy, the king can number the bottles from 0 to 999 (1000 total bottles) and represent each number in binary using 10 bits (since 2^10 = 1024 which is greater than 1000). He can then have each prisoner sample the bottles corresponding to a 1 in a specific bit position. For example, prisoner 1 samples every bottle with a 1 in the 1's place, prisoner 2 samples every bottle with a 1 in the 2's place, and so on. After 24 hours, the prisoners who sampled the poisoned bottle will have died. The binary number represented by the dead prisoners will identify the number of the poisoned bottle. This requires only 10 prisoners and identifies the exact bottle in 24 hours.\n\nB. Having all prisoners sample all 1000 bottles would result in all the prisoners dying, so this would not identify the specific poisoned bottle. \n\nC. Having the prisoners note which bottle tastes bitter would likely poison and kill all the prisoners. The question states the poison is bitter, not that the poisoned wine tastes bitter. Also, this relies on the subjective taste of the prisoners.\n\nD. Dividing the 1000 bottles among 10 prisoners would give each prisoner 100 bottles. If each prisoner sipped from their 100 bottles, the one with the poisoned bottle would die, but this would only narrow it down to a group of 100 bottles, not identify the specific bottle.\n\nTherefore, A is the only answer that would definitively identify the single poisoned bottle within 24 hours using the 10 prisoners.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
