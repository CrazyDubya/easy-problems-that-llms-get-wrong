The host's reveal has effectively transferred that probability to the remaining closed door.\n\n**In simpler terms:**  Imagine there were 100 doors. You pick one.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"A\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is A and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:** The king needs to find *one* poisoned bottle out of 1000, and he only has time for one round of testing (24 hours).\n\n* **Why A is Correct (Binary Search):**\n    1. **Numbering:** Imagine each prisoner represents a place value in a binary number (e.g., prisoner 1 is the 'ones' place, prisoner 2 is the 'twos' place, prisoner 3 is the 'fours' place, and so on).\n    2. **Wine Assignment:** Each bottle of wine is assigned a number from 1 to 1000. Convert that number to binary. If a bottle's binary representation has a '1' in a particular place value, the corresponding prisoner drinks from that bottle. \n       *  Example: Bottle 5 (binary 000000101) would be given to prisoners 1 and 3. \n    3. **Results:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die. The binary representation of the poisoned bottle's number is formed by noting which prisoners died.  A '1' represents a dead prisoner, and a '0' represents a living prisoner.\n    4. **Efficiency:**  Binary search is incredibly efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles in a single round.\n\n* **Why Other Options Are Incorrect:**\n    * **B:**  Tasting the poison is unreliable and likely not instantly noticeable. \n    * **C:**  This would require each prisoner to drink from 1000 bottles, which is impossible.\n    * **D:** Similar to C, this would kill all the prisoners. \n\nLet me know if you'd like a more visual explanation of the binary assignment process!\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
