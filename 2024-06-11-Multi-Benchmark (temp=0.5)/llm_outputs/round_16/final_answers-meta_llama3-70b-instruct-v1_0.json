Since the bulbs are LED and don't get warm when turned on, we can't use temperature as a clue.\n\nThe best approach is to turn each switch on one at a time and observe the bulbs. This allows us to isolate the effect of each switch and identify which bulb it controls.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Turn switch A on and observe the bulbs. If one of them turns on, we know switch A controls that bulb.\n2. Turn switch A off and turn switch B on. If one of the remaining bulbs turns on, we know switch B controls that bulb.\n3.

Option B is not feasible because the poison takes effect 24 hours after consumption, so the prisoners won't be able to taste the bitterness immediately. Option D is also not viable because even if the prisoners take a sip, they won't die immediately, and the king won't be able to identify the poisoned bottle in time.\n\nOption C is tempting, but it's not the most efficient approach. If all prisoners sample each bottle, it would require 1000 tests, which is not necessary.\n\nThe correct answer is Option A. By using a binary search strategy, the king can identify the poisoned bottle with a minimum number of tests. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Assign a unique binary number (0-9) to each prisoner.\n2. Divide the 1000 bottles into two groups of 500 each.\n3. Have each prisoner drink from a bottle corresponding to their binary number (e.g., prisoner 0 drinks from bottles 0-499, prisoner 1 drinks from bottles 0, 2, 4, 6, ..., prisoner 9 drinks from bottles 0, 512, 1024, ...).\n4. Wait 24 hours and observe which prisoners die.\n5. Analyze the results: if a prisoner dies, the poisoned bottle is in the group they drank from; if they survive, it's in the other group.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 with the remaining group until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nUsing this strategy, the king can identify the poisoned bottle in at most 10 tests (2^10 = 1024, which covers the 1000 bottles).\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

For the first person, the probability of having a unique birthday is 365\/365 = 1. For the second person, the probability of having a unique birthday (different from the first person) is 364\/365. For the third person, the probability of having a unique birthday (different from the first two) is 363\/365, and so on.\n\nAs we add more people to the group, the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday increases. To find the number of people required for a 50% chance of at least two people sharing a birthday, we can use the following formula:\n\n1 - (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365) \u2265 0.5\n\nwhere n is the number of people in the group.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate that we need at least 23 people in the room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people share a birthday.\n\nNow, since we're asked about pairs of twins, we need to convert this number to pairs. Since each pair consists of two people, we need:\n\n23 people \/ 2 = 11.5 pairs\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a pair, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need at least 12 pairs of twins in the room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people share a birthday.\n\nHowever, none of the options match this answer. The closest option is D. 23 pairs, which is not correct since we need to convert the number of people to pairs.\n\nUnfortunately, I must conclude that the options provided do not include the correct answer.
