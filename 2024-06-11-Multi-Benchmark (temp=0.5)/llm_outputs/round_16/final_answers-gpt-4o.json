Ask either guardian the following question: \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would they point to?\"\n\n- If you ask the truth-telling guardian, they will tell you that the lying guardian would point to the death door (since the lying guardian always lies).\n- If you ask the lying guardian, they will lie about what the truth-telling guardian would say, and they will also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the door they point to will be the death door.

Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. Number the bottles from 1 to 1000.\n2. Represent each bottle number as a 10-bit binary number (since \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) and we have 1000 bottles, 10 bits are sufficient).\n3. Assign each prisoner to a specific bit position in the binary representation.\n4. Have each prisoner drink from all the bottles where their assigned bit is '1'. For example, prisoner 1 drinks from all bottles where the least significant bit is '1', prisoner 2 drinks from all bottles where the second least significant bit is '1', and so on.\n5. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners are affected by the poison. The combination of affected prisoners will correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle number.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle in one round of testing with the 10 prisoners.\n\nGiven this understanding, the correct choice from the provided answers is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Let's assume the distance to my friend's house is \\( d \\) miles.\n2. Walking to my friend's house at 3 mph takes \\( \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n3. The total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\) miles.\n4. To double the average speed for the entire trip, the average speed should be \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) mph.\n\nNow, let's calculate the time required for the entire trip at the doubled average speed:\n- The total time for the round trip at 6 mph should be \\( \\frac{2d}{6} = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\nHowever, I've already spent \\( \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours walking to my friend's house. This means there is no remaining time to run back if I want to maintain an overall average speed of 6 mph for the entire trip. \n\nIn other words, to achieve an average speed of 6 mph for the entire trip, I would need to run back instantaneously, which is not possible in real-world scenarios.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""}}
