The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is to use a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy involves labeling each bottle with a unique binary number, where each digit in the binary number corresponds to a different prisoner. Each prisoner will then drink a mixture of wines corresponding to the binary digits assigned to them. If a prisoner dies, it means that the bottle corresponding to the binary digit assigned to that prisoner is poisoned.\n\nFor example, if we label the bottles with binary numbers from 0 to 1000 (which would require 10 binary digits), then the first prisoner would drink a mixture of wines from bottles labeled with a 1 in the first binary digit, the second prisoner would drink a mixture of wines from bottles labeled with a 1 in the second binary digit, and so on. If the third prisoner dies, for example, it means that the bottle labeled with a 1 in the third binary digit is poisoned.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing, which takes 24 hours. Therefore, the answer is A.\n\nHere is the answer in JSON format:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
