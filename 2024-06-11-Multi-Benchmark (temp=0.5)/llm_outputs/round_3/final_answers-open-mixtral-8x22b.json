This method minimizes the number of tests needed and can provide a result within 24 hours. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles of wine into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from the bottles in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoners, if any, are affected by the poison.\n4. If a prisoner is affected, the poisoned bottle is in their group of 100. If no prisoners are affected, the poisoned bottle is in the remaining group of 900.\n5. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time possible, as it reduces the number of bottles to be tested by half in each iteration.\n\nOption A is not ideal because it would take too long to test each bottle individually, and the king needs to find the poisoned bottle within 24 hours. Option C is not feasible because it would require each prisoner to drink 1000 bottles of wine, which is not possible in 24 hours and could result in multiple deaths. Option D is not reliable because the poison may not have a bitter taste, and relying on taste alone could result in false positives or false negatives.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
