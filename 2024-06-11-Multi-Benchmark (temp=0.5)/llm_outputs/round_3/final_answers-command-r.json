Here's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Fill the 5-gallon jug and pour its content into the 3-gallon jug. Now, we have one 5-gallon jug and one 3-gallon jug, both partially filled with water.\n2. Pour the remaining water from the 3-gallon jug back into the 5-gallon jug. The 5-gallon jug will now have exactly 2 gallons of water.\n3. Refill the 3-gallon jug and pour the water into the 5-gallon jug, which already has 2 gallons. This will give us a total of 5 gallons in the 5-gallon jug.\n4. From here, we can dispense exactly 4 gallons by transferring the water from the 5-gallon jug into the 4-gallon jug.\n\nThis method ensures we have the desired 4 gallons without any waste or need for precise measurements.\n```","score":""},"28":{"category":"Popular science","question":"A 2kg tree grows in a planted pot with 10kg of soil.
