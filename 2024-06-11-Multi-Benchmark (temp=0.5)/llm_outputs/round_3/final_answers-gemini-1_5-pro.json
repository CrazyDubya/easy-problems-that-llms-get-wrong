Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know the results in 24 hours.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Binary Search:**  Binary search is a highly efficient algorithm for finding a specific item within a sorted set. While the bottles aren't sorted in the traditional sense, we can apply the principle of halving the search space repeatedly.\n\n* **How it works:**\n    1. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n    2. **Number the Bottles:**  Imagine each bottle numbered from 1 to 1000. Convert each bottle number to its binary representation (e.g., bottle 1 is 0000000001, bottle 2 is 0000000010, bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.).\n    3. **Assign Wine Based on Binary:** Each prisoner drinks from bottles where their corresponding prisoner number's bit position is a \"1\" in the bottle's binary representation. For example:\n        * Prisoner 1 (0000000001) drinks from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7...\n        * Prisoner 2 (0000000010) drinks from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7...\n        * Prisoner 8 (0000001000) drinks from bottles 8, 9, 10, 11... \n    4. **Observe After 24 Hours:**  Note which prisoners die. The dead prisoners represent \"1\" bits, and the living prisoners represent \"0\" bits. Construct the binary number based on the dead\/alive status of the prisoners. This binary number will be the decimal number of the poisoned bottle.\n\n* **Efficiency:** With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles using this method. \n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A, C:** These methods are inefficient and could lead to the death of all prisoners without definitively identifying the poisoned bottle.\n* **D:**  Poison takes 24 hours to take effect; tasting it won't provide immediate results. \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
