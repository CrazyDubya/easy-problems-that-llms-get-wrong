Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how the king can use a binary search strategy to identify the poisoned bottle:\n\n1. Label each bottle from 1 to 1000.\n2. Convert each bottle number to its binary representation (e.g., 1 becomes 0000000001, 2 becomes 0000000010, ..., 1000 becomes 1111101000).\n3. Assign each prisoner a binary digit position (0-9) from right to left.\n4. For each bottle, if the binary digit at the prisoner's assigned position is 1, the prisoner drinks from that bottle. If it's 0, the prisoner doesn't drink.\n5. After 24 hours, the king notes which prisoners are alive and which are dead.\n6. The king can then reconstruct the binary representation of the poisoned bottle by looking at which prisoners died. For example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 9 died, the poisoned bottle's binary representation is 0000000101.\n7. The king converts the binary representation back to a decimal number to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in a single 24-hour period using only 10 prisoners.\n\nHere's the answer in JSON format:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Let's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n\nWhen we have only one pair of twins, the probability of both twins having the same birthday is 1 (or 100%), since they are twins.\n\nAs we add more pairs of twins, the probability of at least two people having the same birthday increases. To find the number of pairs needed for a 50% chance, we can use the complementary probability approach: instead of finding the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday, we'll find the probability that no two people share a birthday and then subtract that from 1.\n\nFor a single pair of twins, the probability that they don't share a birthday with anyone else is 364\/365, since there are 364 other possible birthdays.\n\nFor two pairs of twins, the probability that no two people share a birthday is (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365), since we need to exclude two birthdays.\n\nFor three pairs of twins, the probability is (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 (362\/365), and so on.\n\nUsing this approach, we can calculate the probability of no two people sharing a birthday for different numbers of pairs. After some calculations, we find that with 23 pairs of twins, the probability of no two people sharing a birthday is approximately 0.493, which means the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is around 0.507, or just over 50%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
