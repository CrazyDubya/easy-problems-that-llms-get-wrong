The answer might seem counterintuitive, but switching to Door No. 2 actually gives you a **significantly higher chance** of winning the gold bar.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* Initially, each door has a 1\/3 probability of hiding the prize.\n* When you choose Door No. 1, the host, who knows where the prize is, opens one of the remaining doors (let's say Door No. 3) to reveal a rotten vegetable.\n* This new information is crucial. By revealing a vegetable behind Door No. 3, the host has essentially transferred all the probability of the prize being behind Door No. 3 to the remaining unopened door, which is Door No. 2.\n* Therefore, the probability of the prize being behind Door No. 2 becomes 2\/3, while the probability of it being behind your initial choice, Door No. 1, remains at 1\/3.\n\nTherefore, switching to Door No. 2 gives you a **2\/3 chance** of winning the gold bar, while sticking with your initial choice only gives you a **1\/3 chance**.\n\n**Therefore, the answer is:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"D\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Divide the bottles amongst the prisoners:** This method is inefficient as it requires each prisoner to drink from a different bottle, potentially wasting many bottles if the poison is not in their assigned bottle. \n\n**B. Binary Search Strategy:** This approach is promising. We can label the bottles from 1 to 1000 and assign each prisoner a unique binary code from 0 to 9. Each prisoner then tastes the wines corresponding to the \"1\"s in their binary code. After 24 hours, we observe which prisoners die. The dead prisoner's binary code reveals the poisoned bottle. For example, if prisoners 2, 4, and 7 die, the poisoned bottle is 2 + 4 + 7 = 13. This method requires a maximum of 10 tastings, significantly reducing the number of bottles needed compared to option A.\n\n**C. All prisoners sample each bottle:** This is highly inefficient and unnecessary. Each prisoner would need to drink from all 1000 bottles, potentially leading to many unnecessary deaths.\n\n**D. Divide the bottles based on taste:** This method relies on the assumption that the poison has a distinct bitter taste. However, the prompt doesn't guarantee this. Even if the poison is bitter, relying solely on taste is unreliable and could lead to misidentification.\n\n**Therefore, the fastest and most efficient way to identify the poisoned bottle is B.

Instead of calculating the probability of two people sharing a birthday, we'll calculate the probability of **no one** sharing a birthday and then subtract it from 1.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Probability of no shared birthdays:**\n\n   - For the first pair, the probability of not sharing a birthday with anyone is 364\/365 (since there are 364 other days they could be born).\n   - For the second pair, the probability of not sharing a birthday with anyone (including the first pair) is 363\/365.\n   - This continues for each subsequent pair.\n\n   - Therefore, the probability of **no shared birthdays** for n pairs is:\n\n     ```\n     (364\/365) * (363\/365) * ... * ((365 - n + 1)\/365)\n     ```\n\n2. **Complementary probability:**\n\n   - The probability of **at least one shared birthday** is 1 minus the probability of no shared birthdays.\n\n   - So, the probability of at least one shared birthday for n pairs is:\n\n     ```\n     1 - (364\/365) * (363\/365) * ... * ((365 - n + 1)\/365)\n     ```\n\n3. **Finding the minimum n:**\n\n   - We need to find the smallest value of n for which the above probability is greater than or equal to 0.5 (50%).\n\n   - Using trial and error or a calculator, we find that n = 23.\n\nTherefore, with 23 pairs of twins in a room, there is at least a 50% chance that two people will share the same birthday.\n\n## Answer in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n\"ANSWER\": \"B\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
