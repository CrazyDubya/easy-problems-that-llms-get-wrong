The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it's behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, offers you to switch to Door No. 2. Importantly, the host's action implies that Door No. 2 is not hiding the gold bar if Door No. 1 has the gold bar. The host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge of what's behind the doors.\n\n3. **Switching vs. Staying**: \n   - If you stay with Door No. 1, your probability of winning remains 1\/3.\n   - If you switch to Door No. 2, you effectively cover both Door No. 2 and Door No. 3 with a combined probability of 2\/3.\n\nSince switching gives you a 2\/3 chance of winning the gold bar, while staying with your initial choice only gives you a 1\/3 chance, it is statistically advantageous to switch.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is to switch to Door No. 2.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"ANSWER\": \"C\"\n}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Since your opponent fired and no bullet came out, we know the empty chamber was the one they fired.\n\nNow, if you do not spin again, the gun has 5 chambers left, and 4 of those contain bullets. Thus, the probability of the next chamber (the one you would fire) containing a bullet is 4\/5.\n\nIf you spin again, you reset the probabilities to the original state, where there are 6 chambers and 5 bullets, giving you a 5\/6 chance of firing a bullet.\n\nComparing the two probabilities:\n- Not spinning: 4\/5 (or 0.8)\n- Spinning: 5\/6 (or approximately 0.833)\n\nSince 4\/5 (0.8) is less than 5\/6 (0.833), the probability of firing a bullet is lower if you do not spin again.\n\nTherefore, you should not spin again to minimize your risk.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the distance to my friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_1 \\) be the time taken to walk to my friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_2 \\) be the time taken to run back from my friend's house.\n\n2. **Calculate Time to Walk to Friend's House:**\n   - The walking speed is 3 mph.\n   - Therefore, \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n\n3. **Define Average Speed for the Entire Trip:**\n   - The total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\).\n   - Let \\( v_{\\text{avg}} \\) be the average speed for the entire trip.\n\n4. **Target Average Speed:**\n   - We want to double the average speed of the entire trip compared to the walking speed.\n   - Thus, target average speed \\( v_{\\text{avg}} = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) mph.\n\n5. **Calculate Total Time for the Round Trip:**\n   - The total time for the round trip \\( T \\) is \\( t_1 + t_2 \\).\n   - The average speed for the entire trip is given by \\( v_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( 6 = \\frac{2d}{t_1 + t_2} \\).\n\n6. **Substitute \\( t_1 \\):**\n   - We already have \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n   - So, \\( 6 = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{3} + t_2} \\).\n\n7. **Simplify the Equation:**\n   - \\( 6 = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{3} + t_2} \\).\n   - \\( 6 \\left(\\frac{d}{3} + t_2\\right) = 2d \\).\n   - \\( 2d + 6t_2 = 2d \\).\n   - \\( 6t_2 = 0 \\).\n   - \\( t_2 = 0 \\).\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - The time \\( t_2 \\) required to run back must be 0, which implies that the running speed must be infinitely fast to achieve an average speed of 6 mph for the entire trip.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""}}
