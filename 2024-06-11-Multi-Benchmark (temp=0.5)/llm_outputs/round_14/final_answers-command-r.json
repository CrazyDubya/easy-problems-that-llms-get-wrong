To have a 50% chance of two people having the same birthday, we'll need more than half of the 366 possible birthdays represented.  \n\nAssuming each pair of twins has different birthdays, we'll need 183 pairs of twins in the room to meet this criterion.  \n\nHowever, since we're dealing with probabilities, we can also calculate the chances of different pairs of people in the room having the same birthday.  For example, with 23 pairs of twins, the probability isn't just based on the chance of two people having the same birthday, but also the likelihood of multiple pairs having matching birthdays.  Running these probabilities shows that we'd need 46 pairs of twins in the room to have a greater than 50% chance of two people sharing a birthday.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
