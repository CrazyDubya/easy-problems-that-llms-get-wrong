Option A is not efficient, as it would require each prisoner to test 100 bottles, which is a lot of testing. Option B is not possible, as the poison takes effect 24 hours after consumption, so the prisoners can't taste the bitterness. Option C is also not efficient, as it would require each prisoner to test all 1000 bottles, which is impractical.\n\nThe correct answer is Option D, which uses a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Assign a binary number to each bottle, from 0000000000 to 1111101001 (10 digits, 2^10 = 1024, which is greater than 1000).\n2. Divide the prisoners into two groups of 5.\n3. For each prisoner, assign a subset of bottles to test based on the binary number. For example, prisoner 1 tests bottles where the first digit is 0, prisoner 2 tests bottles where the second digit is 0, and so on.\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners die. The binary numbers of the bottles that caused the deaths will reveal the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 5 die, the poisoned bottle's binary number is 01001xxxxx.

We want to find the minimum number of pairs of twins (i.e., people) needed in a room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n2. Since each pair of twins has two people, we can think of this as finding the minimum number of people needed in a room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n3. The key insight here is that we're not looking for the probability that a specific pair of people have the same birthday, but rather that at least one pair of people out of all possible pairs have the same birthday.\n4. Let's assume there are n people in the room. The probability that a single person has a unique birthday (i.e., no one else has the same birthday) is 365\/365, since there are 365 possible birthdays (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n5. The probability that the second person has a unique birthday (different from the first person) is 364\/365, since one birthday is already taken.\n6. The probability that the third person has a unique birthday (different from the first two) is 363\/365, and so on.\n7. The probability that all n people have unique birthdays is the product of these probabilities: (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365).\n8. We want to find the smallest n such that the probability of at least one pair of people having the same birthday is at least 50%. This means we want to find the smallest n such that the probability of all n people having unique birthdays is less than or equal to 50%.\n9. Using a calculator or computer to compute the probabilities, we find that when n = 23, the probability of all 23 people having unique birthdays is approximately 49.3%, which is less than 50%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

It just means that not all rooms are occupied.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. If we ask each current guest to move to the room number n*2, we'll essentially be freeing up all the odd-numbered rooms. Since there are an infinite number of rooms, this will create an infinite number of empty rooms, including room number 1. We can then accommodate the new guest in room number 1.\n\nB. This option is similar to A, but it's not as efficient. If we ask each current guest to move to the next room, we'll just be shifting the occupancy one room to the right.
