Next, race horses A and B against each other. The winner of this race is the fastest horse overall.\n\n3. But we still need to find the second fastest horse.

When your opponent fires the gun and it doesn't go off, we know for certain that the chamber that was aligned with the barrel at that moment was empty.\n\nIf you decide not to spin the chamber again, you would be placing the gun to your head with the next chamber in line. Since we know the previous chamber was empty, the probability of the next chamber containing a bullet is 1 out of the remaining 5 chambers, or 1\/5.\n\nIf you decide to spin the chamber again, the probability of landing on a bullet is the number of bullets (5) divided by the total number of chambers (6), which simplifies to 5\/6.

This strategy allows him to test multiple bottles at once, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000 (which requires 10 digits, as 2^10 = 1024).\n2. Assign each of the 10 prisoners to one of the binary digits.\n3. For each prisoner, prepare a mixture of sips from the bottles where the corresponding binary digit is 1.\n4. Give each prisoner their mixture to drink.\n5. After 24 hours, check which prisoners have died. The binary number corresponding to the dead prisoners indicates the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 2, and 8 died, the poisoned bottle would be binary 1010 (decimal 10), which corresponds to the 10th bottle.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours, as he only needs to wait for the poison to take effect once.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
