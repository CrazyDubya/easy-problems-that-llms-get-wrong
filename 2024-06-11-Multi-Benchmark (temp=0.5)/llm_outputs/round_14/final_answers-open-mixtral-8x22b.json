This method minimizes the number of tests needed and allows the king to know the results in 24 hours. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each prisoner with a binary digit from 0 to 9 (000 to 1001).\n2. Label each bottle of wine with a binary digit from 0 to 999 (0000000000 to 1111101001).\n3. Each prisoner tastes the bottles of wine corresponding to their binary digit in the respective position. For example, prisoner 0 (000) tastes bottles 0, 100, 200, ..., 900. Prisoner 1 (001) tastes bottles 1, 101, 201, ..., 901, and so on.\n4. After 24 hours, the king checks which prisoners have died. The binary representation of the dead prisoners' labels will correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 0, 2, 3, and 7 die, the poisoned bottle is number 0111 (binary), which is 7 (decimal). This method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle in 24 hours, using the least number of prisoners possible.\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Since the distance to the friend's house is the same for both walking and running, we can denote this distance as D.\n\nLet's denote the time taken to walk to the friend's house as T1 and the time taken to run back as T2. Since the speed of walking is 3 mph, the time taken to walk to the friend's house is T1 = D\/3.\n\nLet's denote the speed of running back as S. Therefore, the time taken to run back is T2 = D\/S.\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip (V_avg) is given by the total distance divided by the total time, which is:\nV_avg = 2D \/ (T1 + T2)\n\nSubstituting the expressions for T1 and T2, we get:\nV_avg = 2D \/ (D\/3 + D\/S)\n\nNow, we want to find the speed S such that V_avg is double the walking speed, which is 6 mph. So we set V_avg equal to 6 mph and solve for S:\n6 = 2D \/ (D\/3 + D\/S)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n6 = 2 \/ (1\/3 + 1\/S)\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n18 = 2S \/ (S + 3)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (S + 3), we get:\n18S + 54 = 2S\n\nSubtracting 2S from both sides, we get:\n16S = 54\n\nDividing both sides by 16, we get:\nS = 54 \/ 16\n\nSimplifying this fraction, we get:\nS = 3.375 mph\n\nHowever, this is not an option in the given choices. It seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's try again.\n\nWe want to double the average speed, which is 3 mph. So we want the average speed to be 6 mph. Since the distance is the same for both walking and running, we can set up the equation:\n\n(2D) \/ (D\/3 + D\/S) = 6\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n2 \/ (1\/3 + 1\/S) = 6\n\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n2 = 6 * (1\/3 + 1\/S)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n2 = 2 + 6\/S\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides, we get:\n0 = 6\/S\n\nThis equation does not make sense, as it implies that S is infinite. However, this is not the case, as we are looking for a finite running speed that will double the average speed.\n\nLet's try a different approach. If we want to double the average speed, we need to find a speed S such that the time taken to run back is half the time taken to walk to the friend's house. This is because the average speed is the total distance divided by the total time.\n\nSo we set up the equation:\nD\/S = (1\/2) * (D\/3)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\nS = 6 mph\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. 6mph.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""}}
