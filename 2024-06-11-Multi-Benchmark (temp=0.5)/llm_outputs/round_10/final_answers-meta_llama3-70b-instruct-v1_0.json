The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption, which means that the king can't afford to wait for multiple rounds of testing.\n\nOption A is not the fastest way because it would require each prisoner to test 100 bottles of wine, which would be inefficient and wouldn't guarantee a solution within 24 hours.\n\nOption C is not feasible because it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles of wine, which is impractical and wouldn't provide any meaningful results.\n\nOption D is not a viable solution because the poison is bitter, but it takes effect only after 24 hours, so the prisoners wouldn't be able to taste the bitterness immediately.\n\nOption B, however, is the correct solution. By using a binary search strategy, the king can leverage the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles of wine into two groups of 500 each.\n2. Have 1 prisoner test one group, and another prisoner test the other group.\n3. After 24 hours, one of the prisoners will die, indicating which group contains the poisoned bottle.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 with the remaining group, dividing it into two subgroups of 250 each, and testing them with 2 prisoners.\n5. Continue this process until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nWith 10 prisoners, the king can perform 10 binary searches in parallel, which would require at most 10 tests to identify the poisoned bottle.

We want to find the smallest value of n such that the probability of at least two people having the same birthday is at least 50%.\n\nWe can approach this problem by calculating the probability of the opposite event: no two people having the same birthday. If we can find the probability of this event, we can subtract it from 1 to get the probability of at least two people having the same birthday.\n\nFor the first person, there are 365 possible birthdays (ignoring February 29th for simplicity). For the second person, there are 364 possible birthdays (since we've already used one). For the third person, there are 363 possible birthdays, and so on.\n\nThe probability of no two people having the same birthday is therefore:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-2n+1)\/365)\n\nWe want to find the smallest value of n such that this probability is less than or equal to 0.5.

Option D, \"By putting the guest in an empty room\", is not correct because it doesn't take into account the fact that the hotel is already partially full.\n\nOption C, \"You cannot accommodate one more guest\", is also not correct because the hotel has an infinite number of rooms, so it's always possible to find a way to accommodate one more guest.\n\nOptions A and B are both possible solutions.
