This means calculating the probability of **not** having shared birthdays and subtracting it from 1. \n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Probability of no shared birthdays:**\n\n   Imagine the first twin pair. The probability of them not sharing a birthday is 364\/365 (as there are 364 days remaining that are not their birthday). For the second pair, the probability of not sharing a birthday with the first pair or among themselves is 363\/365. \n\n   We continue this logic for each subsequent pair. Therefore, the probability of **no shared birthdays** for n pairs is:\n\n   ```\n   (364\/365) * (363\/365) * ... * ((365-n)\/365)\n   ```\n\n2. **Probability of at least one shared birthday:**\n\n   To find the probability of at least one shared birthday, we subtract the probability of no shared birthdays from 1:\n\n   ```\n   P(at least one shared birthday) = 1 - (364\/365) * (363\/365) * ... * ((365-n)\/365)\n   ```\n\n3. **Finding the minimum n for 50% chance:**\n\n   We need to find the smallest value of n for which the above probability is greater than or equal to 0.5.
