With 2 people in a room, the probability that they have the same birthday is 1\/365 * 1\/364 = 1\/133,060.\n\nTo get to a 50% chance, we can use the formula for compound probability:\n 1 - 0.5 = 1\/133,060 ^ n = 0.5\n 1 = 2^n\n 2 * 133,060 = n\n n = 26 - 1\n\nTherefore, we need 26 pairs of twins in the room to reach a 50% chance.
