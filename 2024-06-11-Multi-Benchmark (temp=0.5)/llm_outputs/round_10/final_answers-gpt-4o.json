When your opponent spins the chambers and pulls the trigger without a bullet firing, it means that the only empty chamber was selected.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, you are left with one empty chamber and five chambers still containing bullets. Since the revolver did not fire on your opponent, the empty chamber is already known to be in one specific position. Therefore, if you do not spin, you have a 1 in 5 chance of the next chamber being empty (since one of the five remaining chambers must be the empty one).\n\nOn the other hand, if you spin the chambers again, you reset the probabilities. With a fresh spin, the chance of landing on the empty chamber is 1 in 6, because there are six possible chambers and only one is empty.\n\nComparing the two probabilities:\n- Not spinning: 1 in 5 chance of survival (20%)\n- Spinning: 1 in 6 chance of survival (approximately 16.67%)\n\nSince 1 in 5 (20%) is a better probability of survival than 1 in 6 (16.67%), you should not spin the chambers again.\n\nThus, the best choice is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

The classic solution involves asking a question that combines the truth and the lie in a way that reveals the correct door.\n\nHere's the question to ask: \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would they point to?\"\n\n- If you ask the truth-telling guardian, they will tell you that the lying guardian would point to the death door (because the liar would lie about the truth-teller's correct answer).\n- If you ask the lying guardian, they will lie about the truth-teller's answer, and also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the door they point to will be the door that leads to death. Therefore, you should choose the opposite door to find freedom.\n\nThis solution requires only one question.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

We can leverage the concept of binary numbers to achieve this.\n\nEach prisoner can be thought of as representing a binary digit (bit). With 10 prisoners, we can represent numbers from 0 to 2^10 - 1, which is 0 to 1023. This range covers all 1000 bottles of wine.\n\nHere's how it works:\n1. Label each bottle of wine from 1 to 1000.\n2. Convert each bottle number to a 10-bit binary number.\n3. Assign each bit in the 10-bit binary number to a prisoner. For example, if bottle 1 is represented as 0000000001 in binary, only the 10th prisoner will drink from bottle 1.\n4. Each prisoner drinks from the bottles corresponding to the binary digits where they have a '1'. For instance, if bottle 5 is 0000000101 in binary, the 9th and 10th prisoners will drink from this bottle.\n5. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners are affected by the poison.\n6. The combination of prisoners who died will correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle precisely in 24 hours using the 10 prisoners.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
