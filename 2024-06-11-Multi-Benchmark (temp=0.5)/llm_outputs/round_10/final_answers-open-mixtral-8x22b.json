The king can divide the bottles of wine into two groups of 500, and give one group to each of the first two prisoners to test. The prisoners will take a sip from each bottle in their group and note any ill effects. If a prisoner becomes ill, the king will know that the poisoned bottle is in that group. If neither prisoner becomes ill, the king will know that the poisoned bottle is in the untested group. The king can then continue to divide the remaining bottles into smaller groups and test them until the poisoned bottle is identified. This strategy will allow the king to identify the poisoned bottle with the fewest number of tests possible.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Since the walking speed is 3mph, we'll assume that the time taken to walk to the friend's house is 1 hour (for simplicity, as distance is not provided). Thus, the total distance to the friend's house is 3 miles.\n\nNow, let's denote the running speed as R mph. The return trip would also take 1 hour if the running speed is R.\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is given by the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance for the round trip is 6 miles (3 miles to the friend's house and 3 miles back), and the total time is 2 hours (1 hour to walk and 1 hour to run).\n\nSo, the average speed for the entire trip is:\nAverage speed = Total distance \/ Total time = 6 miles \/ 2 hours = 3 mph\n\nHowever, we want to double the average speed for the entire trip, so the new average speed should be 6 mph. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n6 mph = 6 miles \/ Total time\n\nSince the total distance is still 6 miles, the total time must be 1 hour to achieve an average speed of 6 mph. This means that the running speed R must be 6 mph, as the walking speed is already 3 mph, and the total time for the round trip is 2 hours.\n\nHence, the correct answer is:\nC. 6mph\n\nIn JSON format:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""}}
