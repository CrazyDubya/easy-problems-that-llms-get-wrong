What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"Here is my analysis:\n\nThe key insight is to use the 10 prisoners to essentially create a 10-bit binary number that can uniquely identify up to 1024 bottles (2^10). Each prisoner represents one bit.\n\nThe king numbers the bottles from 0 to 999. He lines up the prisoners and gives a small sip from bottle 0 to every prisoner whose \"place value\" in binary has a 1 in the 1's place. He gives a sip from bottle 1 to every prisoner with a 1 in the 2's place. He continues this for all 1000 bottles, giving a sip to the corresponding prisoners based on the binary representation of the bottle number.\n\nAfter 24 hours, the prisoners who drank the poison will have died. By seeing which prisoners died, the king can construct the binary number that identifies the poisoned bottle. For example, if prisoners 1, 4, 5, and 8 died, that forms the binary number 0001011001, or bottle #89.\n\nThis clever strategy allows testing 1000 bottles with just 10 prisoners in only 24 hours. The other options either require too many prisoners, too much time, or are not guaranteed to identify the correct bottle.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Each pair of twins shares the same birthday.\n2. We need to find the number of pairs such that the probability of no two people sharing the same birthday is less than 50%.\n3. The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be calculated using the formula: (365 \u00d7 364 \u00d7 363 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 (365 - n + 1)) \/ 365^n, where n is the number of people in the room.\n4. In this case, n = 2 \u00d7 (number of pairs of twins), as each pair consists of two people.\n5. Plugging in the values for each option:\n   - A. 46 pairs (92 people): The probability of no shared birthdays is extremely low, much less than 50%.\n   - B. 12 pairs (24 people): The probability of no shared birthdays is around 49.95%, which is close to but slightly higher than 50%.\n   - C. 1 pair (2 people): The probability of no shared birthdays is 99.73%, much higher than 50%.\n   - D. 23 pairs (46 people): The probability of no shared birthdays is around 0.06%, much lower than 50%.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is B. 12 pairs of twins (24 people) in a room would result in a probability of just under 50% that no two people share the same birthday, meaning there is a slightly higher than 50% chance that at least two people have the same birthday.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
