Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"```json\n{\n\"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n\"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is B and how it works:\n\n* **A is incorrect** because it only allows for testing 10 bottles at a time, leaving 990 bottles unchecked.\n* **C is incorrect** because it's highly impractical and dangerous, likely leading to the death of all prisoners. \n* **D is incorrect** because the poison is stated to take effect only after 24 hours, making taste a useless factor.\n\n**B is correct** because of the efficiency of binary search:\n\n1. **Numbering:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.  Also, imagine each bottle numbered from 1 to 1000.\n2. **Binary Representation:**  Think of each prisoner representing a place value in a binary number (e.g., prisoner 1 is the 'ones' place, prisoner 2 is the 'twos' place, prisoner 3 is the 'fours' place, and so on, up to 1024).\n3. **Giving Wine:**  For each bottle, give a sip to the prisoners whose number corresponds to the '1' bits in the bottle's binary representation.  \n    * For example, bottle number 3 (binary 0000000011) would be given to prisoners 1 and 2. Bottle 5 (binary 0000000101) would be given to prisoners 1 and 3.\n4. **Observation:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who die represent the '1' bits in the binary representation of the poisoned bottle number. \n    * For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, you know the poisoned bottle is number 21 (00000010101 in binary).\n\n**Why Binary Search Works:** This method is highly efficient because it allows you to test a large number of possibilities with a small number of tests. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles simultaneously.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
