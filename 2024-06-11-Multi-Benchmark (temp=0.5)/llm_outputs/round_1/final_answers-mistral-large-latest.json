Here's how to think about it:\n\nInitially, the probability of the gold bar being behind each door is 1\/3. When you choose a door, say Door No. 1, the probabilities don't change - there's still a 1\/3 chance the gold bar is behind Door No. 1.\n\nHowever, the host, who knows what's behind the doors, always opens a door with rotten vegetables. This action provides new information and changes the probabilities. Since the host can't open Door No. 1 (your choice), they will always open either Door No. 2 or Door No. 3.\n\nLet's say the host opens Door No. 3 and reveals rotten vegetables. Now, the probability distribution changes. The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 remains 1\/3, but since Door No. 3 has been revealed to have rotten vegetables, the entire 2\/3 probability initially shared by Doors No. 2 and No. 3 now shifts to Door No. 2.\n\nSo, switching your choice to Door No. 2 gives you a 2\/3 chance of winning the gold bar, while sticking with Door No. 1 gives you only a 1\/3 chance.\n\nHere's the answer in JSON format:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy. This strategy allows him to test multiple bottles at once, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000, which requires up to 10 binary digits (since 2^10 = 1024). For example, the first bottle would be 0000000001, the second bottle would be 0000000010, the third bottle would be 0000000011, and so on.\n\n2. Assign each prisoner to one of the binary digits. For example, the first prisoner would be responsible for the first binary digit, the second prisoner for the second binary digit, and so on.\n\n3. For each test, give a prisoner a sip of wine from each bottle where the corresponding binary digit is 1. For example, if a bottle is labeled 0000001011, then prisoners 1, 3, and 10 would take a sip from it.\n\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners have died. The binary number formed by their corresponding digits will indicate the poisoned bottle. For example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 10 died, then the poisoned bottle would be 0000001011.\n\nThis method allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing, making it the fastest way to find the poisoned bottle.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
