Option A is not effective because turning all switches on at once won't provide any useful information.

The probability that a single person has a unique birthday (i.e., no one else shares their birthday) is `(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365)`, since there are 365 possible birthdays, and each subsequent person has one fewer possible birthday that doesn't match anyone else's.\n\nNow, we want to find the smallest `n` such that the probability of at least one pair sharing a birthday is greater than or equal to 50%. This means we need to find the smallest `n` such that the probability of all people having unique birthdays is less than or equal to 50%.\n\nUsing the formula above, we can calculate the probability of all people having unique birthdays for different values of `n`. After some calculations (or using a calculator), we find that:\n\n* For `n = 23`, the probability of all people having unique birthdays is approximately 49.3%, which means the probability of at least one pair sharing a birthday is approximately 50.7%.\n* For `n = 22`, the probability of all people having unique birthdays is approximately 52.4%, which means the probability of at least one pair sharing a birthday is less than 50%.\n\nSo, the smallest number of pairs of twins (i.e., people) needed in a room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday is... **23**!\n\nHere's the answer in JSON format:\n\n`{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}`","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

This means that there are always more rooms available, no matter how many guests are currently staying.\n\nThe correct answer is B. You ask each current guest to move to the room number n*2.\n\nHere's how it works: suppose the hotel currently has guests in rooms 1, 2, 3, ..., n. To accommodate one more guest, you ask each guest to move to the room that is twice their current room number. So, the guest in room 1 moves to room 2, the guest in room 2 moves to room 4, the guest in room 3 moves to room 6, and so on.\n\nThis frees up all the odd-numbered rooms, including room 1.
