In this scenario, the total time to get everyone across the bridge would be the sum of their individual crossing times: 1 minute + 2 minutes + 5 minutes + 10 minutes = 18 minutes.\n\nHowever, if the slowest person, D, were to cross the bridge first, they could hold the torch for the duration of their crossing, and the other three people could follow in quick succession without needing the torch passed to them. In this case, the total time would be optimised by having B, C and A cross the bridge back-to-back, with only a minute's gap between each person. This equates to a total time of 9 minutes + the time it takes for A to cross the bridge with the torch, which we don't know.\n\nAs the fastest time between these two scenarios depends on the unknown variable of the torch's handling, the correct answer is B: There is not enough information to determine the fastest time.","score":""},"15":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You're in a room with two doors that lead out.
