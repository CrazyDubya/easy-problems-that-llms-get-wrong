With 10 prisoners, you can represent numbers up to 1023 (2^10 - 1).\n    3. **Wine Mixtures:**  Each prisoner is given a small sample from specific bottles based on their corresponding 'bit' position:\n        * Prisoner 1:  Gets a sip from every bottle with a '1' in the units place of their binary representation (1, 3, 5, 7... 999).\n        * Prisoner 2: Gets a sip from every bottle with a '1' in the twos place (2, 3, 6, 7... 1000).\n        * ...and so on.\n    4. **Decoding the Result:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die.

It can find the poisoned bottle out of 1000 in just one round of testing.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B', 'Explanation': \"Here's why the answer is B and how it works:* **The Problem:** Identify one poisoned bottle out of 1000 with only 10 test subjects and a 24-hour time limit.* **Why A, C, and D are incorrect:**    * **A & C:**  These methods are inefficient and potentially require more than 10 prisoners. You'd need a prisoner for each bottle to guarantee finding the poisoned one in a single test.    * **D:** This assumes the poison is immediately detectable by taste, which isn't stated in the problem.* **Why B is correct (Binary Search):**    1. **Numbering:** Imagine numbering the bottles from 1 to 1000.    2. **Binary Representation:** Each prisoner represents a 'bit' in a binary number. With 10 prisoners, you can represent numbers up to 1023 (2^10 - 1).    3. **Wine Mixtures:**  Each prisoner is given a small sample from specific bottles based on their corresponding 'bit' position:        * Prisoner 1:  Gets a sip from every bottle with a '1' in the units place of their binary representation (1, 3, 5, 7... 999).        * Prisoner 2: Gets a sip from every bottle with a '1' in the twos place (2, 3, 6, 7... 1000).        * ...and so on.    4. **Decoding the Result:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die. The binary representation of the poisoned bottle is formed by noting which prisoners died:        * If Prisoner 1 dies, the units place of the binary number is '1'.        * If Prisoner 2 dies, the twos place is '1'.         * ...and so on.    5. **Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0100100001, which converts to 577. Therefore, bottle number 577 is poisoned.* **Efficiency:** Binary search is incredibly efficient. It can find the poisoned bottle out of 1000 in just one round of testing.\"}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"77":{"level_0":77,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours.**\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Binary Search Efficiency:** Binary search is highly efficient for sorted data. While the bottles aren't physically sorted, we can apply the logic by numbering them. Each prisoner represents a 'bit' in a binary number.\n* **How it Works:**\n    1. **Number the Bottles:** Assign each bottle a number from 0 to 999.\n    2. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 0 to 9.\n    3. **Binary Representation:**  Each bottle's number is converted to its binary equivalent. For example, bottle 5 is 000000101 in binary.\n    4. **Prisoner Assignment:**  Each prisoner drinks from bottles where their corresponding 'bit' position in the bottle's binary number is a '1'.  For example:\n        * Prisoner 0 (least significant bit) drinks from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7...\n        * Prisoner 1 drinks from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7...\n        * Prisoner 2 drinks from bottles 4, 5, 6, 7... and so on.\n    5. **Decoding the Result:** After 24 hours, the dead\/alive status of the prisoners forms a binary code. A '1' represents a dead prisoner, and a '0' a living one. This binary code directly translates to the poisoned bottle number.\n\n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    * **B:**  This is highly inefficient and morally wrong. It also doesn't guarantee finding the bottle if the poison is slow-acting.\n    * **C:** The poison is tasteless, as stated in the problem.\n    * **D:**  Similar to B, this is unethical and doesn't guarantee finding the bottle within the time limit. \n","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"167":{"level_0":167,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nD. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION.

Convert each bottle number into its binary equivalent (up to 10 digits since 2^10 = 1024). \n    3. **Assign Wine:** Each prisoner drinks from bottles where the bottle's binary representation has a '1' in the prisoner's corresponding digit position. \n        *  For example: Prisoner #3 drinks from bottles where the *third* digit in the bottle's binary number is a '1'.\n    4. **Observe After 24 Hours:**  The prisoners who die represent a '1' in their corresponding binary digit.
