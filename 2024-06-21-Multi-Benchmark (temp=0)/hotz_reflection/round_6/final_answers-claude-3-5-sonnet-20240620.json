By offering you Door No. 2, they are implicitly telling you that Door No. 3 doesn't have the gold bar (assuming it's not behind your initial choice, Door No. 1).\n\n5. So, by switching to Door No. 2, you're actually choosing the probability of the gold bar being behind either Door No. 2 or Door No. 3, which is 2\/3.\n\n6.

Only two people can cross the bridge at a time.\n2. The torch must be used for every crossing.\n3. The torch must be brought back for the next group to cross.\n4. When two people cross together, they must move at the speed of the slower person.\n\nLet's think through the optimal strategy:\n\n1. The two fastest people (A and B) cross first: 2 minutes\n2. A returns with the torch: 1 minute\n3. The two slowest people (C and D) cross: 10 minutes\n4. B returns with the torch: 2 minutes\n5. A and B cross again: 2 minutes\n\nTotal time: 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes\n\nThis strategy minimizes the time the slowest people spend on the bridge and maximizes the use of the fastest people for returning the torch.\n\nTherefore, the fastest time they can all get across the bridge is 17 minutes.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n\nREFLECTION TASK\nReview the question carfully and assess your initial answer.

The tree grows from 2kg to 3kg, which means it gained 1kg in mass.\n\n3. In nature, plants get their mass primarily from carbon dioxide in the air and water. They don't directly consume soil mass to grow.\n\n4. However, they do absorb nutrients from the soil. But the amount of nutrients absorbed is negligible compared to the overall soil mass.\n\n5. Therefore, even though the tree has grown, the soil mass remains essentially unchanged.\n\n6.

At 3 mph, the time taken to walk there is x\/3 hours.\n\n3. For the entire trip to have an average speed of 6 mph (double the walking speed), the total time for both ways should be x\/6 hours.\n\n4.

Let me reconsider:\n\n1. The question asks for the speed to double the average speed for the entire trip, not to make the return journey instantaneous.\n\n2.
