One person crossing the bridge takes 1 minute, so the total time required for everyone to cross is the sum of their individual times: 1 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 18 minutes. However, since they are sharing one torch, the torch would need to be passed from the slowest person (D) to the fastest person (A) across the bridge. This adds an extra 3 minutes (the time it takes for the torch to be passed between D and A) to the total, bringing it to 18 + 3 = 21 minutes. Finally, we must subtract the time needed for the fastest person (A) to cross the bridge twice, once to cross to the other side and once to return, which takes 2 minutes in total, bringing the answer to 21 - 2 = 19 minutes. Since the question asks for the fastest time, the final answer is 19 minutes minus the time taken for the person with the torch (A) to walk back across the bridge, a total of 19 - 1 = 18 minutes. \n\nThis can be further reduced to 14 minutes by having the two fastest people (A and B) run across the bridge together, as the torch would only need to be carried across the bridge once, reducing the total time by an additional 1 minute.\n\nREFLECTION TASK\nReview the question carfully and assess your initial answer.

We want to know how many pairs of twins, each with their own birthday, would be needed so that there's a 50% chance two people in the room share a birthday.  \n\nAssuming no month or season preferences, each birth month is equally likely, so we can divide the year into 12 months of 30 days each.
