This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000 (which requires 10 digits).\n2. Assign each digit position to a different prisoner.\n3. If a prisoner tests positive for poison (i.e., they die within 24 hours), then the corresponding digit in the binary number of the poisoned bottle is 1. If they test negative, the digit is 0.\n4. After 24 hours, the king can read off the binary number formed by the test results to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours, as he only needs to wait for the results of the first round of tests.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n\nREFLECTION TASK\nReview the question carfully and assess your initial answer.

Fill the 5-gallon jug completely.\n2. Pour water from the 5-gallon jug into the 4-gallon jug until it's full. This leaves you with 1 gallon of water in the 5-gallon jug.\n3.
