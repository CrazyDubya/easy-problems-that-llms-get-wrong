Convert each bottle number into its binary equivalent (up to 10 digits since 2^10 = 1024). \n    3. **Assign Wine:** Each prisoner drinks from bottles where the bottle's binary representation has a '1' in the prisoner's corresponding digit position. \n        *  For example: Prisoner #3 drinks from bottles where the *third* digit in the bottle's binary number is a '1'.\n    4. **Observe After 24 Hours:**  The prisoners who die represent a '1' in their corresponding binary digit. The prisoners who live represent a '0'.\n    5. **Construct the Binary Number:**  Use the dead\/alive status of the prisoners to construct a binary number.  For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0100100001.\n    6. **Convert to Decimal:** Convert this binary number back to decimal form. This decimal number is the poisoned bottle number.\n\n* **Example:** If bottle #365 is poisoned:\n    * Binary of 365 is 0101101101\n    * Prisoners 1, 3, 4, 6, and 10 would drink from this bottle and die.\n    * The king would construct the binary number 0101101101, indicating bottle #365.\n\n* **Efficiency:** This method is incredibly efficient.
