When two people cross, they must move at the speed of the slower person.\n3. The torch must be brought back by someone for the others to use.\n\nThe optimal strategy is to send the two fastest people (A and B) across first, then have the fastest (A) return with the torch.

So, we can calculate:\n   Initial soil mass: 10kg\n   Mass taken by the tree: 1kg\n   Remaining soil mass: 10kg - 1kg = 9kg\n\n5. Therefore, when the tree grows to 3kg, there will be 9kg of soil left.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is D. 9kg.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}"},"28":{"category":"Relational","question":"A man steps over a 0.5m hurdle.

The man steps \"over\" the hurdle, which means he clears it.\n3. To clear a hurdle, one must raise their center of mass high enough to get their legs over the top of the hurdle.\n4. However, the question asks for the \"minimum height he could have jumped.\"\n\nThe key here is understanding that stepping over a hurdle doesn't necessarily mean jumping vertically to the full height of the hurdle. In an efficient hurdle technique, an athlete raises their center of mass just enough to clear the hurdle while extending their legs to the side and over the top.\n\nGiven this, the minimum height the man could have jumped is actually very close to 0m. He could theoretically lift his feet just slightly off the ground while extending his legs to the side to clear the hurdle. This would require flexibility and technique rather than a high vertical jump.\n\nTherefore, the answer that best fits this reasoning is B. 0m.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n\nREFLECTION TASK\nReview the question carfully and assess your initial answer.

Here's my reflection:\n\n1. The question specifically asks for the \"minimum height he could have jumped.\"\n2. While it's true that a person can clear a hurdle without jumping to its full height, some vertical displacement is necessary.\n3. Stepping over a 0.5m hurdle without any vertical jump at all (0m) is not physically possible for most people, as it would require extraordinary flexibility and technique.\n4. The minimum height would need to be slightly above 0m to allow for the necessary clearance, even with optimal technique.\n\nGiven this reflection, the most accurate answer is A. \"Slightly higher than 0.5m\". This accounts for the minimum vertical displacement needed to clear the hurdle, while still allowing for efficient hurdling technique that doesn't require jumping the full height of the hurdle.\n\nTherefore, I am amending my answer to:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":"","multi_choice_question_pre":"QUESTION\n    A man steps over a 0.5m hurdle.
