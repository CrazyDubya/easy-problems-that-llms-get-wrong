Even a tiny sip of poison could be deadly.\n    * **C:** This would require 1000 prisoners (one per bottle), far more than the king has.\n\n* **Solution: Binary Search**\n    1. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n    2. **Number the Bottles:**  Imagine each bottle of wine is numbered from 0 to 999. Convert each bottle number into its binary representation (up to 10 digits, since 2^10 = 1024). For example:\n        * Bottle 1 = 0000000001\n        * Bottle 5 = 0000000101\n        * Bottle 765 = 1011111101 \n    3. **Assign Wine:** Each prisoner drinks from bottles based on their corresponding binary digit. For example:\n        * Prisoner #1 (representing the rightmost binary digit) drinks from every bottle where the binary representation ends in a 1 (1, 3, 5, 7, 9....).\n        * Prisoner #2 (representing the second digit from the right) drinks from every bottle where the binary representation has a 1 in the second position from the right (2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11...).\n        * And so on...\n    4. **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, some prisoners will die.

Here's a recap of why:\n\n* **Time Sensitivity:** The 24-hour time limit necessitates a solution that identifies the poisoned bottle in a single round of testing.\n* **Limited Resources:** The king only has 10 prisoners, making individual testing or less efficient approaches infeasible.\n* **Power of Binary:** Binary representation allows for a large number of possibilities (1024 bottles) to be encoded and tested using only 10 prisoners.
