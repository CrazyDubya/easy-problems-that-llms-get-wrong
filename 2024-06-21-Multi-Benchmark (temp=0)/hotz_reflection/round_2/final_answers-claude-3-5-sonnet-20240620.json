The tree grows from 2kg to 3kg, which means it gained 1kg in mass.\n\n3. This additional 1kg of mass must have come from somewhere. In a closed system like a pot, the most likely source is the soil. The tree absorbs nutrients and water from the soil to grow.\n\n4. So, if the tree gained 1kg, the soil must have lost 1kg.\n\n5. Initial soil mass: 10kg\n   Soil mass lost to tree growth: 1kg\n   Remaining soil mass: 10kg - 1kg = 9kg\n\nTherefore, when the tree grows to 3kg, there will be 9kg of soil left in the pot.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n\nREFLECTION TASK\nReview the question carfully and assess your initial answer.

The tree grows from 2kg to 3kg, which means it gained 1kg in mass.\n\n3. This additional 1kg of mass must have come from somewhere. In a closed system like a pot, the most likely source is the soil. The tree absorbs nutrients and water from the soil to grow.\n\n4. So, if the tree gained 1kg, the soil must have lost 1kg.\n\n5. Initial soil mass: 10kg\n   Soil mass lost to tree growth: 1kg\n   Remaining soil mass: 10kg - 1kg = 9kg\n\nTherefore, when the tree grows to 3kg, there will be 9kg of soil left in the pot.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}"},"28":{"category":"Relational","question":"A man steps over a 0.5m hurdle.
