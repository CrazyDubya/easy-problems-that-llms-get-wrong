Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    \n\nINITIAL ANSWER\nThe fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is not by dividing the bottles amongst the prisoners and getting them to take a sip (Option A) because this method does not leverage the 24 hours time frame and could potentially kill all the prisoners. Option C is not valid because the poison is not bitter but takes effect after 24 hours. Option D is also not valid because it would kill all the prisoners.\n\nThe correct answer is Option B. The king can use a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number that is 10 digits long (because we have 10 prisoners and 1000 bottles). This is possible because 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000.\n2. For each prisoner, assign them a specific digit in the binary number (1 through 10).\n3. If the digit for a prisoner is a 1 in a bottle's binary number, that prisoner drinks from that bottle.\n4. After 24 hours, the prisoners who are still alive did not drink from the poisoned bottle. The king can then look at the binary numbers of the bottles that the dead prisoners drank from.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    \n\nINITIAL ANSWER\nTo double your average speed for the entire trip, you would need to travel back at a speed that is twice your initial speed. This is because the average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. If you walk to your friend's house at 3mph and run back at a speed of X, the average speed would be (3mph + X mph) \/ 2. To double your initial speed of 3mph, you would want this average to be 6mph.\n\nSo, we set up the equation: (3mph + X mph) \/ 2 = 6mph.
