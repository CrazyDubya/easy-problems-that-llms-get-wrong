Return in JSON format, for example:\n{\"ANSWER\": C}\n","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"{\n\"ANSWER\": \"C\"\n}\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe most efficient way to solve this classic puzzle is to use a binary search approach:\n\n* **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n* **Number the Bottles:**  Imagine each bottle of wine is assigned a number from 1 to 1000.  Convert each bottle number to its binary representation (e.g., bottle 1 is 0000000001, bottle 2 is 0000000010, bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.).\n* **Each Prisoner = A Binary Digit:** Each prisoner represents a specific digit place in the binary numbers (prisoner 1 is the ones place, prisoner 2 is the twos place, prisoner 3 is the fours place, and so on).\n* **Prisoners Drink According to Binary:** For each bottle, a prisoner drinks if their corresponding binary digit in that bottle's number is a \"1\". For example:\n    * Bottle 5 (binary 0000000101): Prisoners 1 and 3 would drink.\n    * Bottle 7 (binary 0000000111): Prisoners 1, 2, and 3 would drink.\n* **Observe After 24 Hours:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die.  Create a binary number where a \"1\" represents a dead prisoner and a \"0\" represents a living prisoner. This binary number will directly correspond to the poisoned bottle number.\n\n**Why this works:** Binary search is incredibly efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles. \n","score":"","multi_choice_question_pre":"QUESTION\n    The Poisoned Wine - A king has 1000 sweet bottles of wine, and one contains a very bitter poison.

Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n* **Understanding Average Speed:** Average speed isn't simply the average of the two speeds. It's calculated as the total distance divided by the total time.\n\n* **Setting up the Problem:** Let's say the distance to your friend's house is 'd'.\n    * Time spent walking (at 3 mph):  d\/3\n    * Let 'x' be the speed you need to run back.\n    * Time spent running back (at 'x' mph): d\/x\n\n* **Average Speed Equation:**  To have an average speed of 6 mph (double the walking speed), the equation would be: \n    * (2d) \/ (d\/3 + d\/x) = 6 \n\n* **Solving for 'x':**\n    * Simplify: 2 \/ (1\/3 + 1\/x) = 6\n    * Multiply both sides by (1\/3 + 1\/x): 2 = 2 + 6\/x\n    * Subtract 2 from both sides: 0 = 6\/x\n    * To satisfy this equation, x needs to approach infinity. However, the question asks for a realistic speed.  The average speed will approach 6mph as x increases. The answer closest to a realistic speed that significantly increases the average speed is 9mph. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":"","multi_choice_question_pre":"QUESTION\n    I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.
