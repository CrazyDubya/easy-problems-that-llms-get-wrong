We know that W = 3mph. We want to find R such that the average speed for the entire trip (A) is twice the walking speed:\n\nA = (W + R) \/ 2 = 2W\n\nSubstituting the value of W, we get:\n\n(3 + R) \/ 2 = 2 * 3\n\nSolving for R, we get:\n\n3 + R = 12\nR = 12 - 3\nR = 9mph\n\nHowever, this is the speed that would make the average speed for the entire trip equal to twice the walking speed, not the speed that would double the average speed for the entire trip.
