The tree grows from 2kg to 3kg, which means it gained 1kg in mass.\n\n3. In nature, plants get their mass primarily from carbon dioxide in the air and water. They don't directly consume soil mass to grow.\n\n4. The soil might lose some mass due to water evaporation or nutrients being absorbed, but this amount would be negligible compared to the tree's growth.\n\n5. Therefore, the amount of soil should remain essentially the same as it was at the beginning.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the amount of soil left should still be 10kg.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}"},"28":{"category":"Relational","question":"A man steps over a 0.5m hurdle.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    \n\nINITIAL ANSWER\nLet's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Let's say the distance to your friend's house is x miles.\n\n2. At 3 mph, the time taken to walk there is x\/3 hours.\n\n3. Let's say the speed to run back is y mph. The time taken to run back would be x\/y hours.\n\n4. The total time for the round trip is (x\/3 + x\/y) hours.\n\n5. The total distance covered is 2x miles.\n\n6. For the average speed of the entire trip to be double the walking speed (i.e., 6 mph), we need:\n\n   2x \/ (x\/3 + x\/y) = 6\n\n7.

This means there's no finite speed at which you can run back to make the average speed of the entire trip exactly double your walking speed.\n\n9.
