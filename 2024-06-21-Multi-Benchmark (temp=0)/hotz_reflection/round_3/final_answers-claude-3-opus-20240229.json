A binary search approach leveraging binary numbers is the optimal solution.\n\nHere's how it would work:\n- Number the bottles from 0 to 999\n- Assign each prisoner a \"bit\" from 0 to 9 (10 prisoners = 10 bits, enough to represent the 1000 bottle numbers in binary)\n- Each prisoner samples every bottle whose number has their bit set. For example, prisoner 0 samples bottles 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. Prisoner 1 samples bottles 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. \n- After 24 hours, line up the prisoners in their bit order. The prisoners that drank the poison will have died. The survivors represent a 0 and the deceased a 1 in that bit position.\n- The resulting binary number of 0s and 1s will point to the number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 0, 3, 5, and 7 died, that forms the binary number 0101001010 which is 330 in decimal. So bottle 330 is the poisoned one.\n\nThis approach only requires 10 prisoners and 24 hours to test 1000 bottles, as opposed to hundreds of prisoners or waiting many days with other methods.
