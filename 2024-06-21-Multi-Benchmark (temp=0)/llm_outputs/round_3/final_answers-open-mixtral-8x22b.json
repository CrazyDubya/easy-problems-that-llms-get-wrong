What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC.

He can assign each prisoner a unique binary number from 0 to 1023 (which can be represented using 10 bits). For each bottle of wine, the king can calculate its binary number by taking the XOR of the binary numbers of the prisoners who taste that bottle. After 24 hours, the king can identify the poisoned bottle by finding the XOR of the binary numbers of the surviving prisoners. This method guarantees that the king can identify the poisoned bottle with only 10 tests, as long as there is only one poisoned bottle.\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
