You'd need a prisoner for each bottle to guarantee finding the poisoned one in a single test.\n    * **D:** This assumes the poison is immediately detectable by taste, which isn't stated in the problem.\n\n* **Why B is correct (Binary Search):**\n\n    1. **Numbering:** Imagine numbering the bottles from 1 to 1000.\n    2. **Binary Representation:** Each prisoner represents a 'bit' in a binary number. With 10 prisoners, you can represent numbers up to 1023 (2^10 - 1).\n    3. **Wine Mixtures:**  Each prisoner is given a small sample from specific bottles based on their corresponding 'bit' position:\n        * Prisoner 1:  Gets a sip from every bottle with a '1' in the units place of their binary representation (1, 3, 5, 7... 999).\n        * Prisoner 2: Gets a sip from every bottle with a '1' in the twos place (2, 3, 6, 7... 1000).\n        * ...and so on.\n    4. **Decoding the Result:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die. The binary representation of the poisoned bottle is formed by noting which prisoners died:\n        * If Prisoner 1 dies, the units place of the binary number is '1'.\n        * If Prisoner 2 dies, the twos place is '1'. \n        * ...and so on.\n    5. **Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0100100001, which converts to 577. Therefore, bottle number 577 is poisoned.\n\n* **Efficiency:** Binary search is incredibly efficient. It can find the poisoned bottle out of 1000 in just one round of testing.\"\n}\n``` \n",

It's the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. \\n\\n* **The Problem:**  Since you're traveling the same distance to and from your friend's house, to double your average speed, you would need to cut the total time in half. However, you've already used a certain amount of time walking to their house.  \\n\\n* **The Impossibility:**  To reduce the total time by half, you would need to make the return trip in zero time, which is impossible. Even running at incredibly high speeds, you'll always take *some* time for the return journey. \\n\\n**Therefore, no matter how fast you run back, you cannot double your average speed for the entire trip.**\"\n}\n``` \n",
