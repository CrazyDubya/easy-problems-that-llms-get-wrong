What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nD. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"Here is my analysis:\n\nThe key to solving this efficiently is to use the 10 prisoners in a way that minimizes the number of tests needed to identify the poisoned bottle out of 1000 bottles. A binary search strategy is optimal.\n\nHere's how it would work:\n- Number the bottles from 1 to 1000\n- Have each prisoner sample wine from specific bottles based on the binary representation of the bottle numbers\n- For example:\n    - Prisoner 1 samples every bottle whose number has a 1 in the 1's place (odd numbers)\n    - Prisoner 2 samples every bottle with a 1 in the 2's place (2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, ...)\n    - Prisoner 3 samples every bottle with a 1 in the 4's place (4-7, 12-15, 20-23, ...)\n    - And so on for all 10 prisoners, with the 10th prisoner sampling bottles with a 1 in the 512's place\n- After 24 hours, line up the prisoners in order\n- The poisoned bottle number will be revealed by considering each prisoner that died as a 1 and each that lived as a 0\n- For example, if prisoners 1, 4, 5, and 7 died, the poisoned bottle number is 0101010001 in binary, or 337 in decimal\n\nThis leverages the prisoners as \"bits\" to efficiently search the sample space in the minimum number of tests. The other options either require too many tests or rely on taste which may be unreliable.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
