Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nD. 2000m from starting point, 900m elevation.\n\nHere's the explanation:\n\n1. The man starts at 0m elevation and walks straight for 1 km, reaching 300m elevation. This means he has climbed 300m in 1 km, so the slope is 300m\/km or 30%.\n2. He then turns left and walks straight for another 1 km, reaching 500m elevation. This means he has climbed another 200m in 1 km, so the slope is still 30%.\n3. He turns left again and walks straight for another 1 km, reaching 900m elevation. This means he has climbed another 400m in 1 km, so the slope is still 30%.\n4. He turns left again and walks straight for another 1 km. Since he is walking on the same slope, he will climb another 300m, reaching a final elevation of 1200m. However, the question asks for his elevation after walking 4 km, which is 900m.\n5. To find his distance from the starting point, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. Since he has walked 4 km in a square pattern, his distance from the starting point is the diagonal of the square. The diagonal of a square with side length 1 km is \u221a(1^2 + 1^2) = \u221a2 km, which is approximately 1.414 km. However, since he has walked 4 km, his total distance from the starting point is 4 km + \u221a2 km \u2248 5.414 km. Since he is walking in a square pattern, he is actually 2 km away from the starting point horizontally and 2 km away vertically, so his total distance from the starting point is 2\u221a2 km \u2248 2.828 km.

This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from one bottle in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours. If none of the prisoners die, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was not tested. If one prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in their group.\n4. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles and prisoners until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to narrow down the search for the poisoned bottle quickly and efficiently, using the minimum number of prisoners necessary. It also ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours, which is critical for the event.\n\nOption A is not a good choice because it risks the lives of all the prisoners unnecessarily. Option B is not practical because it would require each prisoner to drink from 1000 bottles of wine, which is not feasible. Option C is not reliable because the poison may not have a noticeable taste. Therefore, option D is the best choice.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
