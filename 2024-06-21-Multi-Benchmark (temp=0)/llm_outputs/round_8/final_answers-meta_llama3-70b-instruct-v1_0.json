Since the bulbs are LED and don't get warm when turned on, we can't use temperature to identify them.\n\nOption A, turning all switches on at once, won't help us identify which switch controls which bulb. We'll just see all three bulbs lit up, but we won't know which switch controls which one.\n\nOption B is irrelevant, as we don't need to walk into another room to observe the bulbs.\n\nOption C is a clever idea, but it won't work because the bulbs are LED and don't get warm when turned on. So, touching the bulbs won't give us any information.\n\nOption D is the correct approach. By turning each switch on one at a time and observing the bulbs, we can identify which switch controls which bulb. For example, if we turn switch A on and the red bulb lights up, we know that switch A controls the red bulb. Then, we can turn switch A off and turn switch B on. If the blue bulb lights up, we know that switch B controls the blue bulb. Finally, we can turn switch B off and turn switch C on.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"Here's my explanation and answer:\n\nThe key to this problem is to use the prisoners efficiently to identify the poisoned bottle within the 24-hour time constraint. Option B is not the best approach, as it would require each prisoner to test 100 bottles, which is not efficient. Option C is not possible, as the poison takes effect 24 hours after consumption, so the prisoners won't be able to taste the bitterness immediately. Option D is also not feasible, as it would require each prisoner to test all 1000 bottles, which is impractical.\n\nThe correct approach is to use a binary search strategy, as described in Option A. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a binary number from 0 to 999 (using 10 binary digits).\n2. Assign each prisoner a unique binary number from 0 to 9 (using 10 binary digits).\n3. For each bottle, if the i-th binary digit is 1, the prisoner with the corresponding binary number i will drink from that bottle.\n4. After 24 hours, the prisoners who died will indicate which bottles contain the poison.\n5. By analyzing the binary numbers of the prisoners who died, the king can identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 5 died, the king can deduce that the poisoned bottle has a binary number with the 1st, 3rd, and 5th digits set to 1. This corresponds to a unique bottle number, which can be calculated using the binary representation.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it uses the 10 prisoners to test multiple bottles simultaneously, reducing the number of tests needed to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
