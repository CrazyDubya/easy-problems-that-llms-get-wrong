This method minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from the bottles in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoner, if any, was affected by the poison.\n4. If a prisoner was affected, the poisoned bottle is in their group. If no prisoner was affected, the poisoned bottle is in the remaining group of 100 bottles.\n5. Repeat the process with the remaining group of 100 bottles, dividing them into 10 groups of 10 bottles each and assigning them to the prisoners.\n6.
