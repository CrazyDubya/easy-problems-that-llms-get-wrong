What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nC.

By treating each prisoner as a binary digit, you can uniquely identify up to 2^10 (1024) bottles with just 10 prisoners. Each prisoner drinks from a subset of the bottles based on their assigned 'binary digit'. After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who died will point to the binary number of the poisoned bottle.
