Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"D\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is D and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:**  The king needs to test 1000 bottles with only 10 prisoners and one chance to observe the results (after 24 hours).\n\n* **Why A, B, and C are incorrect:**\n    * **A & C:** These methods risk killing all the prisoners. \n    * **B:**  The poison is stated to be effective only after 24 hours, so a taste test won't reveal the poisoned bottle.\n\n* **Why D is correct (Binary Search):**\n\n    1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.  Think of these numbers in binary (e.g., Prisoner 1 is 001, Prisoner 2 is 010, Prisoner 3 is 011, etc.).  Similarly, assign each bottle of wine a number from 1 to 1000 and convert it to binary.\n\n    2. **Sampling:** Each prisoner will drink from bottles based on their corresponding binary digit. For example:\n        * **Prisoner 1 (001):** Drinks from bottles where the *last* binary digit is a 1.\n        * **Prisoner 2 (010):** Drinks from bottles where the *second to last* binary digit is a 1.\n        * **Prisoner 3 (011):** Drinks from bottles where the *last* OR *second to last* binary digit is a 1. \n\n    3. **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die.  Let's say prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die. This forms the binary code 011001, which converts to the decimal number 25, indicating bottle number 25 was poisoned.\n\n* **Efficiency:** Binary search is incredibly efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles in a single round. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is because we're looking at the probability of *any* two people sharing a birthday, not just one specific person.\n\n* **Twins and the Paradox:**  Each pair of twins guarantees a shared birthday.  Therefore, we can treat each pair of twins as a single 'unit' for the purpose of the birthday paradox. To have a greater than 50% chance of two 'units' sharing a birthday, we need approximately 23 'units'.\n\n* **Conclusion:** Since our 'units' are pairs of twins, we need 23 pairs of twins in a room to have a greater than 50% chance of two people having the same birthday. \"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
