This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from the bottles in their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours to see which prisoner dies.\n4. If no prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was not assigned to any prisoner.\n5. If a prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was assigned to that prisoner.\n6. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles in the group that contains the poisoned bottle.\n\nBy using this strategy, the king can identify the poisoned bottle in just 10 tests, which is the minimum number of tests needed to find the poisoned bottle among 1000 bottles.\n\nOption A is not a good choice because it would require the king to wait for 24 hours after each test, which would take too long. Option B is not a good choice because the poison is bitter, but the prisoners may not be able to taste it. Option C is not a good choice because it would require all of the prisoners to drink from all of the bottles, which would be too risky.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

However, we can use a variable, let's say \"d\", to represent the distance.\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time.

The time it takes to walk to my friend's house is d\/3 (distance divided by walking speed), and the time it takes to run back is d\/r (distance divided by running speed).\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is then:\n\nAverage speed = (Total distance) \/ (Total time)\nAverage speed = (2d) \/ (d\/3 + d\/r)\n\nWe want this average speed to be 6mph, so we can set up the equation:\n\n6 = (2d) \/ (d\/3 + d\/r)\n\nTo solve for \"r\", we can simplify the equation:\n\n6 = 2 \/ (1\/3 + 1\/r)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (1\/3 + 1\/r) gives:\n\n6 * (1\/3 + 1\/r) = 2\n\n2 + 6\/r = 2\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides gives:\n\n6\/r = 0\n\nThis equation has no solution, which means that it's not possible to double the average speed for the entire trip by running back at any finite speed.
