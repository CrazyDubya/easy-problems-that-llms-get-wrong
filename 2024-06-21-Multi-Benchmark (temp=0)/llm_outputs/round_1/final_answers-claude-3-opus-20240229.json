Assign each prisoner a unique binary number from 0 to 9 (e.g. 0000000001, 0000000010, etc.). Then, have each prisoner sample only the bottles whose position in the sequence of 1000 bottles corresponds to a 1 in their binary number. After 24 hours, line up the prisoners in their binary number order. The positions of the sick\/dead prisoners will reveal the binary number of the poisoned bottle. For example, if prisoners 2, 5 and 8 are sick\/dead, then the 2nd, 5th and 8th bits are 1, so the poisoned bottle is number 0010100100 (binary) = 164 (decimal). This leverages the concept of using the prisoners as 'bits' in a 10-bit binary number, allowing you to uniquely identify all 1000 bottles with just 10 prisoners, and get the result in just 24 hours.\",\n  \"ANSWER\": \"D\"\n}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
