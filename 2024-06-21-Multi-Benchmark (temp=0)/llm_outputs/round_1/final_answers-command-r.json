To determine the probability of two people having the same birthday, we can use the formula for combinations: C(n, r) = r!(n\u22121)! \/ (r+n\u22121)! where r is the number of possible outcomes and n is the total number of possible birthdays.\n\nWith 23 pairs of twins in the room, we can calculate the probability as follows: C(366, 2) = 18394 * 365 \/ (2 * 366) \u2248 0.5049.

The 4-gallon jug is the closest in capacity to the desired measurement, so it's the most logical choice. However, we can't simply fill it because we don't have an exact 4-gallon measure. \n\nThe solution is to use the 3-gallon jug to standardize the measurement. Here's the process:\n\n1. Fill the 3-gallon jug.\n2. Pour the 3 gallons into the 4-gallon jug, which will now be exactly half full.\n3. Refill the 3-gallon jug.\n4. Carefully pour the water from the 3-gallon jug into the half-full 4-gallon jug until it's full. This will displace an exact 1 gallon of water from the 4-gallon jug.\n5. Now we have 1 gallon of water in the 3-gallon jug, which can be poured into the 2-gallon jug twice to measure exactly 4 gallons. \n\nThis method doesn't involve any guesswork or pouring by sight, ensuring an accurate measurement of 4 gallons.","score":""},"28":{"category":"Popular science","question":"A 2kg tree grows in a planted pot with 10kg of soil.
