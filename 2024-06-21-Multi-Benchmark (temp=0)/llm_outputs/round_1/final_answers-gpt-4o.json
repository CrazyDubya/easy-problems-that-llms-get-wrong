Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initial Choice**: You initially pick Door No. 1. The probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability that it is behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n\n2. **Host's Action**: The host, who knows what is behind each door, offers you the chance to switch to Door No. 2. Importantly, the host's offer implies that Door No. 2 is not the door with the rotten vegetables (if it were, the host would not offer it).\n\n3. **Switching Strategy**: If you switch to Door No. 2, you are effectively betting that the gold bar is behind one of the two doors you did not initially pick (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3). Since the host's offer to switch is based on knowledge of the doors' contents, switching increases your chances of winning.\n\n4. **Probability Analysis**:\n   - If you stick with Door No. 1, your probability of winning remains 1\/3.\n   - If you switch to Door No. 2, your probability of winning increases to 2\/3 because the host's offer to switch is based on the knowledge that Door No. 2 is not a losing door.\n\nTherefore, switching to Door No. 2 gives you the biggest advantage.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"C\"\n}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This means there is only one empty chamber. When your opponent spins the chambers and fires, he lands on the empty chamber, leaving five chambers, all of which are loaded with bullets.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again, you will be firing the revolver with the next chamber in sequence. Since there are five bullets and only one empty chamber, the probability that the next chamber contains a bullet is very high (5 out of 5, or 100%).\n\nIf you spin the chambers again, you reset the probabilities. With five bullets in six chambers, the probability of landing on the empty chamber is 1 out of 6, or approximately 16.67%.\n\nTherefore, spinning the chambers again gives you a better chance of survival because the probability of landing on the empty chamber is higher when you spin (1\/6) compared to not spinning (0\/5).\n\nGiven this analysis, the best choice is to spin the chambers again.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"4":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Given that the poison takes exactly 24 hours to take effect, we can use a binary representation strategy to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each bottle can be represented by a unique binary number from 0 to 999 (since there are 1000 bottles). This requires 10 bits (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000).\n\n2. **Assigning Bottles to Prisoners**: Each of the 10 prisoners will represent a bit in the binary number. For each bottle, if a bit is set to 1, the corresponding prisoner will drink from that bottle. For example, if bottle 5 is represented as 0000000101 in binary, then prisoners 1 and 3 will drink from it.\n\n3. **Identifying the Poisoned Bottle**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will form a binary number. This binary number will directly correspond to the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle with the minimum number of tests and within the given time frame.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The birthday paradox states that in a group of 23 people, there is a better than even chance that at least two people share the same birthday. This is due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, where the number of possible pairs grows rapidly with the number of people.\n\nIn the case of twins, each pair of twins shares the same birthday. Therefore, if we have \\( n \\) pairs of twins, we effectively have \\( 2n \\) individuals, but with the constraint that each pair shares a birthday.\n\nTo find the number of pairs of twins needed for a 50% chance that at least two people (from different pairs) share the same birthday, we can use the same logic as the birthday paradox but adjust for the fact that each pair of twins counts as one unique birthday.\n\nFor a 50% chance of a shared birthday among \\( 2n \\) individuals, we use the birthday paradox threshold of 23 individuals. Since each pair of twins counts as one unique birthday, we need half the number of pairs to reach the same probability threshold.\n\nThus, we need:\n\\[ 23 \/ 2 = 11.5 \\]\n\nSince we can't have half a pair, we round up to the next whole number, which is 12 pairs of twins.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"To determine how fast I would need to run back to double my average speed for the entire trip, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the distance to my friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_1 \\) be the time taken to walk to my friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_2 \\) be the time taken to run back.\n\n2. **Calculate Time to Walk:**\n   - I walk to my friend's house at 3 mph.\n   - Time to walk to my friend's house: \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n3. **Total Distance and Desired Average Speed:**\n   - The total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\).\n   - To double the average speed for the entire trip, the desired average speed is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) mph.\n\n4. **Calculate Total Time for Desired Average Speed:**\n   - The total time for the round trip at the desired average speed of 6 mph: \\( t_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{2d}{6} = \\frac{d}{3} \\) hours.\n\n5. **Determine Time to Run Back:**\n   - The total time for the round trip is the sum of the time to walk to my friend's house and the time to run back: \\( t_1 + t_2 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n   - We already know \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( \\frac{d}{3} + t_2 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n\n6. **Solve for \\( t_2 \\):**\n   - Subtract \\( \\frac{d}{3} \\) from both sides: \\( t_2 = 0 \\).\n\nThis implies that I would need to run back in zero time to achieve the desired average speed, which is impossible. Therefore, I would need to run back at an infinitely fast speed.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":""}}
