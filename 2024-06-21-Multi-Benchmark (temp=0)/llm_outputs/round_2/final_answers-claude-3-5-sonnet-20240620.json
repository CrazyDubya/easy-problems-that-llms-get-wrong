We need to find a way to determine which door leads to freedom with the least number of questions.\n\n2. The key is to ask a question that will give us the correct information regardless of which guard we ask.\n\n3. We can do this by asking a question that involves both guards. For example: \"If I asked the other guard which door leads to freedom, what would he say?\"\n\n4. If we ask this to the truthful guard:\n   - He would truthfully tell us what the lying guard would say.\n   - The lying guard would point to the death door.\n   - So the truthful guard would point to the death door.\n\n5. If we ask this to the lying guard:\n   - He would lie about what the truthful guard would say.\n   - The truthful guard would point to the freedom door.\n   - But the lying guard would say the opposite, so he would point to the death door.\n\n6. In both cases, the guard we ask will point to the death door.\n\n7. Therefore, we know that the door NOT pointed to is the freedom door.\n\n8. We only need to ask this one question to determine which door leads to freedom.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that only one question is needed to determine the door to safety.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

The poison takes effect in 24 hours, which is the same timeframe we have to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\n2. We can't rely on taste, as the poison is described as \"very bitter\" but the wine is \"sweet,\" so it might mask the taste.\n\n3. We have 10 prisoners available for testing.\n\n4. We need to test all 1000 bottles in a single round of testing, as we only have 24 hours.\n\nThe key to solving this efficiently is to use the prisoners as binary indicators. Here's how it would work:\n\n1. Number the bottles from 0 to 999.\n2. Convert each bottle number to its binary representation (10 bits can represent numbers 0-1023).\n3. Assign each prisoner to a bit position (1st prisoner = least significant bit, 10th prisoner = most significant bit).\n4. For each bottle, if its binary representation has a '1' in a certain position, the corresponding prisoner drinks from that bottle.\n5. After 24 hours, the prisoners who die will indicate the binary number of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 7 die, the poisoned bottle number in binary is 1010000010, which is 642 in decimal.\n\nThis method allows us to test all 1000 bottles in a single round, using our 10 prisoners as binary indicators, and we'll know the result in exactly 24 hours.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
