But we've already spent x\/3 hours walking there. So the time for the return trip must be 0.\n\n6. To cover distance x in 0 time, you would need to run infinitely fast.\n\nThis might seem counterintuitive, but it's because we're dealing with average speed. No matter how fast you run back, as long as it takes any time at all, the average speed for the entire trip will be less than double your walking speed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""}}
