Assign each prisoner a unique 3-digit binary number from 000 to 111. Have each prisoner sample a drop of wine from a bottle if and only if the bottle number (in binary) has a 1 in the corresponding digit of the prisoner's number. After 24 hours, line up the prisoners in their binary number order. The binary number formed by their alive\/dead (0\/1) status will be the number of the poisoned bottle.
