However, we can do this efficiently by using a process of elimination. Here's one way to do it:\n\n1. Race 3 horses against each other. This will give us a ranking of these 3 horses (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd).\n2. Take the winner of the first race and race it against one of the remaining 3 horses. If the winner of the first race wins again, it's likely the fastest horse. If not, the new winner is likely the fastest.\n3. Take the winner of the second race and race it against the remaining horse. This will give us the final ranking.\n\nThis process requires a minimum of 3 races. We can't do it with just 1 race, because we need to compare each horse with multiple others to determine the fastest.

Option A is not feasible as it would require each prisoner to test 1000 bottles, which is impractical. Option B is also not optimal as it would still require each prisoner to test 100 bottles, and there's no guarantee that the poisoned bottle would be identified. Option D is not possible as the poison takes effect 24 hours after consumption, so the prisoners wouldn't be able to taste the bitterness immediately.\n\nThe correct answer is Option C, which uses a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle of wine with a binary number from 0 to 999 (using 10 binary digits).\n2. Divide the prisoners into two groups of 5.\n3. For each binary digit (0-9), have one group of prisoners drink from the bottles with a 0 in that digit position, and the other group drink from the bottles with a 1 in that digit position.\n4.

This is a classic problem of birthday probability.\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity). For a single person, the probability of having a birthday on a specific day is 1\/365.\n\nNow, let's consider a group of people. For the first person, the probability of having a birthday on a specific day is 1\/365. For the second person, the probability of having a different birthday than the first person is 364\/365, since one day is already taken. For the third person, the probability of having a different birthday than the first two is 363\/365, and so on.\n\nTo find the probability that at least two people share a birthday, we can use the complementary probability, which is the probability that all people have different birthdays. We can then subtract this probability from 1 to get the probability that at least two people share a birthday.\n\nUsing this approach, we can calculate the probability that at least two people share a birthday for different group sizes. It turns out that with 23 people, the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is greater than 50%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

This means that there is no such thing as a \"next\" room, as there is always another room beyond the current one.\n\nAt first glance, it might seem like option B, \"You cannot accommodate one more guest,\" is the correct answer. However, this is not the case. The puzzle states that the hotel is \"partially full,\" which implies that there are some guests already occupying some of the rooms. But it's still possible to accommodate one more guest.\n\nOption C, \"By putting the guest in an empty room,\" is also not correct. While it's true that there must be an empty room somewhere in the infinite hotel, we can't simply put the new guest in that room. We need to make room for the new guest while still accommodating the existing guests.\n\nThe correct answer is option D, \"You ask each current guest to move to the room number n*2.\" This solution works because it allows us to free up room 1, which can then be occupied by the new guest.
