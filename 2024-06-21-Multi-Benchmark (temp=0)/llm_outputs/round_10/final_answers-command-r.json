Doubling this speed gives us 12mph. However, this is an idealised scenario and in practice, the actual time spent walking will vary from 50% of the total trip time, meaning 12mph would not be achievable as an average speed. Instead, opting for a conservative estimate of the return journey speed required to double the average, we arrive at 9mph as a more realistic answer.","score":""}}
