However, in this case, we're starting with pairs that already share birthdays. This significantly reduces the number of pairs we need.\n\n4.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Let's say the distance to your friend's house is x miles.\n\n2. At 3 mph, the time taken to walk there is x\/3 hours.\n\n3. Let's say the speed to run back is y mph. The time taken to run back would be x\/y hours.\n\n4. The total time for the round trip is (x\/3 + x\/y) hours.\n\n5. The total distance covered is 2x miles.\n\n6. For the average speed of the entire trip to be double the walking speed (i.e., 6 mph), we need:\n\n   2x \/ (x\/3 + x\/y) = 6\n\n7. Simplifying this equation:\n   12\/3 + 12\/y = 2\n   4 + 12\/y = 2\n   12\/y = -2\n   y = -6\n\n8. However, speed can't be negative. This means there's no finite speed at which you can run back to make the average speed of the entire trip exactly double your walking speed.\n\n9. No matter how fast you run back, the average speed will approach, but never quite reach, double your walking speed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is that you would need to run infinitely fast.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""}}
