The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"A\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and allows the king to find the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink a small amount of wine from each bottle in their group.\n3. Wait 24 hours to see which prisoner, if any, dies.\n4. If a prisoner dies, then the poisoned bottle is in their group. If no one dies, then the poisoned bottle is in the remaining 900 bottles.\n5. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles and prisoners until the poisoned bottle is found.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to narrow down the search for the poisoned bottle quickly and efficiently. By using a binary search strategy, the king can find the poisoned bottle in as few as 10 tests, which is much faster than the other options provided.\n\nOption B is not a viable solution because it would require all 10 prisoners to drink from all 1000 bottles, which would take too long and could result in multiple deaths. Option C is not a reliable method because the poison may not have a noticeable taste, and the prisoners may not be able to identify the poisoned bottle. Option D is also not a viable solution because it would require multiple prisoners to die in order to identify the poisoned bottle.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
