The key is that the host knows what's behind the doors and always opens a door with rotten vegetables after you make your initial pick. \n\nWhen you first choose door 1, you have a 1\/3 chance of the gold bar being behind that door. The other 2\/3 chance is that the gold bar is behind one of the other two doors.\n\nAfter you pick door 1, the host opens another door, say door 3, to reveal rotten vegetables. The host always opens a door with rotten vegetables.\n\nNow the choice is between sticking with door 1 or switching to door 2. \n\nIf you stick with door 1, you will win if the gold bar is behind door 1, which has a 1\/3 probability.\n\nIf you switch to door 2, you will win if the gold bar was originally behind door 2 or door 3. There's a 2\/3 chance the gold bar was behind one of those two doors to start with. And since the host revealed door 3 has rotten vegetables, door 2 must have the gold bar if the gold bar was behind door 2 or 3 originally.\n\nTherefore, switching to door 2 has a 2\/3 probability of winning, while sticking with door 1 has only a 1\/3 probability.

The probability of no two people sharing the same birthday can be calculated using the formula: (365 \u00d7 364 \u00d7 363 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 (365 - n + 1)) \/ 365^n, where n is the number of people in the room.\n4. Since each pair of twins counts as two people, we need to find the value of n such that the probability is less than 50% when n = 2 \u00d7 (number of pairs).\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate:\n- For 1 pair (2 people): (365 \u00d7 364) \/ 365^2 \u2248 99.7% (greater than 50%)\n- For 12 pairs (24 people): (365 \u00d7 364 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 342) \/ 365^24 \u2248 49.3% (less than 50%)\n\nTherefore, we need at least 12 pairs of twins in the room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

If the other track is empty, then pulling the lever is the clear ethical choice to save five lives.

Different ethical frameworks would analyze this dilemma differently.\n\nUltimately, given the information provided, pulling the lever seems to be the ethical choice because it would save the five lives in danger, and there is no indication of it putting anyone else at risk.
