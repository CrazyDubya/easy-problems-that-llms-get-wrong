Two:** This is insufficient. With two races, we can only compare three horses in each race. This leaves the possibility of two horses having the same best time, requiring an additional race to break the tie.\n\n**B. Three:** This is the minimum number of races required. Here's how:\n\n* **Race 1:** Divide the six horses into two groups of three and race them. This identifies the fastest horse in each group.\n* **Race 2:** Race the two winners from Race 1 to determine the overall fastest horse.\n* **Race 3 (optional):** If there is a tie for second place in Race 1, conduct a race between the tied horses to determine the third fastest horse.\n\n**C.

He then comes back alone.\n\nNow, the farmer needs to bring one of the animals across.\n\n4. **Taking the goat across:** If the farmer takes the goat across, he cannot leave it alone with the wolf. So, he needs to bring the cabbage back. This completes one round trip.\n5. **Taking the wolf across:** The farmer takes the wolf across and leaves it with the goat.

Turning two switches on for a while, turn one off, then touching the bulbs to see which is warm and which one is on:** This method is flawed because LED bulbs do not emit significant heat, making it impossible to differentiate between the on and off bulbs by touch.\n    * **B. You must walk into another room to observe the bulbs:** This option is unnecessary and impractical. Observing the bulbs from the same room is sufficient.\n    * **C. Turning all of the switches on at once and observing the bulbs:** This approach might identify which bulbs are connected to the switches, but it wouldn't tell you which switch controls which specific bulb.\n\n**Explanation for D:**\n\nTurning on each switch individually allows you to directly observe which bulb lights up with each switch.

Let's analyze the provided options:\n\n**A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.**\n\nThis approach is flawed. While the poison might be bitter, there's no guarantee it will be noticeable in the wine. Some poisons are tasteless, and relying solely on taste could lead to missing the poisoned bottle.\n\n**B. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.**\n\nThis option is unnecessarily risky. Sacrificing all the prisoners is a drastic measure, especially when other methods can achieve the same goal without casualties.\n\n**C. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.**\n\nThis approach is inefficient and wasteful. Each prisoner would need to drink 1000 sips, potentially leading to multiple deaths and providing no clear indication of the poisoned bottle.\n\n**D. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours.**\n\nThis is the optimal solution. By employing a binary search strategy, we can efficiently identify the poisoned bottle within the 24-hour timeframe. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label the bottles 1 to 1000.\n2. Divide the prisoners into 10 groups, each responsible for a specific range of bottles.\n3. Each group tests half of their assigned bottles. If a prisoner dies within 24 hours, the poisoned bottle is within that half. If not, the poison is in the remaining half.\n4. Repeat step 3 with the remaining bottles, dividing the groups and testing half the remaining bottles each time.\n5. With each round, the range of potentially poisoned bottles is halved, allowing for quick identification.\n\nThis method utilizes the binary system's efficiency, minimizing the number of tests needed and ensuring the poisoned bottle is found within 24 hours.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\n\"ANSWER\": \"D\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
