Here's such a question:\n\n\"If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\nHere's why this works:\n- If you're asking the truthful guard, they will truthfully tell you what the lying guard would say, which would be the wrong door (death).\n- If you're asking the lying guard, they will lie about what the truthful guard would say, which would also be the wrong door (death).\n\nSo, regardless of which guard you ask, the answer will always point to the death door.

We can only get one set of results after 24 hours.\n\nThe key to solving this efficiently is to use the 10 prisoners to represent binary numbers. Here's how it works:\n\n1.

How fast would I have to run back to double my average speed for the entire trip?","human_answer":"Instantaneously fast, it is mathematically impossible.","correct_answer":"Infinitely fast","multiple_choice":["6mph","Infinitely fast","12mph","9mph"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph. How fast would I have to run back to double my average speed for the entire trip?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. 6mph\nB. Infinitely fast\nC. 12mph\nD. 9mph\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Let's say the distance to your friend's house is x miles.\n\n2. At 3 mph, the time taken to walk there is x\/3 hours.\n\n3. Let's say the speed to run back is y mph. The time taken to run back would be x\/y hours.\n\n4. The total time for the round trip is (x\/3 + x\/y) hours.\n\n5. The total distance covered is 2x miles.\n\n6. For the average speed of the entire trip to be double the walking speed (i.e., 6 mph), we need:\n\n   2x \/ (x\/3 + x\/y) = 6\n\n7. Simplifying this equation:\n   12\/3 + 12\/y = 6\n   4 + 12\/y = 6\n   12\/y = 2\n   y = 6\n\n8. This means you would need to run back at 6 mph to make the average speed of the entire trip 6 mph, which is double your walking speed.\n\nHowever, this is not one of the given options. The closest option is 9 mph.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n\nNote: While 6 mph is the exact answer, 9 mph is the closest option provided and would indeed result in an average speed greater than 6 mph for the entire trip.","score":""}}
