This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and allows the king to know the results in 24 hours. Here's how it works: Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them drink from their assigned bottles. After 24 hours, the prisoner who drank from the poisoned group will be dead, and the other 9 prisoners will be alive. Now, take the group of 100 bottles that the dead prisoner drank from and divide it into 10 groups of 10. Assign each group to a new prisoner and have them drink from their assigned bottles. After 24 hours, the prisoner who drank from the poisoned group will be dead, and the other 9 prisoners will be alive. Repeat this process until you have identified the poisoned bottle. This strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in the shortest amount of time possible, using only 10 prisoners.\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
