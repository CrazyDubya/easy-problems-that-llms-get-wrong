Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"D\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is D and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:**  The king needs to find a single poisoned bottle out of 1000, and he only has time for one round of testing (since the poison takes 24 hours to work).\n\n* **Why A, B, and C won't work:**\n    * **A:**  The poison is tasteless, the problem states it's only distinguishable by bitterness after the poison takes effect.\n    * **B & C:** These methods would kill all the prisoners and waste all the wine.\n\n* **Why D is the solution (Binary Search):**\n\n    1. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n\n    2. **Number the Bottles:**  Imagine each bottle of wine is numbered from 1 to 1000. Convert each bottle number into its binary representation (e.g., bottle 1 is 0000000001, bottle 2 is 0000000010, bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.).\n\n    3. **Assign Wine Based on Binary:** Each prisoner will drink from bottles based on their corresponding binary digit. \n        * For example:\n            * Prisoner 1 drinks from every bottle where the *last* binary digit is a 1.\n            * Prisoner 2 drinks from every bottle where the *second to last* binary digit is a 1.\n            * ...and so on.\n\n    4. **Observe After 24 Hours:**  After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died.  Create a binary number where:\n        * A '1' represents a dead prisoner.\n        * A '0' represents a living prisoner.\n\n    5. **Convert Binary to Decimal:** This final binary number you created directly translates to the poisoned bottle number!\n\n* **Example:** Let's say prisoners 1 and 3 die. This would form the binary number 0000000101, which converts to the decimal number 5. Therefore, bottle number 5 is poisoned.\n\n* **Efficiency:** This method is incredibly efficient because it uses the power of binary representation. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles simultaneously! \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
