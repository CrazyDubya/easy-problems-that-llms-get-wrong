Race 1: Divide the horses into two groups of three and race them separately. This will give you the fastest horse from each group.\n2. Race 2: Race the fastest horse from each group against each other. The winner of this race is the fastest horse overall.\n3.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy. This strategy allows him to test multiple bottles at once and eliminate large groups of bottles in a single test.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number between 0 and 1000. Since 10 bits are required to represent numbers up to 1000, each bottle can be represented by a unique 10-digit binary number.\n\n2. Assign each of the 10 prisoners to one of the binary digits. For example, Prisoner 1 could represent the first digit, Prisoner 2 the second digit, and so on.\n\n3. For each test, give a prisoner a sip of wine from each bottle where the corresponding binary digit is 1. For example, if Prisoner 1 is given wine from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., that means those bottles all have a 1 in the first binary digit.\n\n4. After 24 hours, if a prisoner dies, it means the poisoned bottle had a 1 in the corresponding binary digit. If a prisoner survives, it means the poisoned bottle had a 0 in the corresponding binary digit.\n\n5. By looking at which prisoners died and which survived, the king can determine the unique binary number, and thus the specific bottle, that contains the poison.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
