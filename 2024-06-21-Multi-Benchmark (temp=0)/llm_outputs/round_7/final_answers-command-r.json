Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n\nThe probability of two people in a group having the same birthday is calculated using the formula for combinations: n!\/(2!(n - 2)!). For there to be a 50% chance of two people sharing a birthday, we need to solve the equation n!\/(2!(n - 2)!) = 0.5. \n\nAssuming a year has 365 days, each individual's chance of having a particular birthday is 1\/365. With two people in the room, the likelihood of them having the same birthday is 1\/365 * 1\/365 = 1\/133,050. This probability is significantly lower than 50%. \n\nWe now introduce the concept of pairs of twins, each of whom has the same birthday by definition. With each pair of twins, the likelihood of a match increases. Using the same formula as before, we find that 23 pairs of twins are required to reach a 50% probability of a birthday match.","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
