This is a crucial part of the problem because the host will always be able to do this (since there are always two doors with rotten vegetables).\n- At this point, switching doors (to the one you didn't initially pick and wasn't opened by the host) effectively gives you the odds that were initially against the two doors you didn't pick, which is 2\/3.\n\nSo, if you initially picked door No. 1, and the host asks if you want to switch to door No. 2 (assuming door No. 3 was opened to reveal rotten vegetables), switching to door No. 2 gives you a 2\/3 chance of winning the gold bar, while sticking with door No. 1 keeps your odds at 1\/3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

If you spin again, the probability of hitting an empty chamber (if you added one, assuming the question implies the game continues under standard Russian roulette rules) resets to 1\/6, or approximately 16.67%.

Spinning again gives you a chance of survival, contrary to the initial logic provided. The explanation seems to have misinterpreted the scenario's implications on survival chances.

Option B is irrelevant because the question states that the bulbs are in the same room as the switches, making it unnecessary to walk into another room to observe the bulbs.

This method allows you to directly observe which switch controls which bulb without any ambiguity.","score":""},"17":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"The Poisoned Wine - A king has 1000 sweet bottles of wine, and one contains a very bitter poison.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"To solve this problem, let's first understand what is being asked. We need to find the speed at which you must run back to double the average speed of the entire trip (both walking to your friend's house and running back).\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(d\\) as the distance to your friend's house (the same distance will be covered on the way back).\n- \\(v_1 = 3\\) mph as the speed walking to your friend's house.\n- \\(v_2\\) as the unknown speed running back.\n- \\(T_1\\) as the time to walk to your friend's house.\n- \\(T_2\\) as the time to run back.\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is calculated as the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance is \\(2d\\) (to your friend's house and back), and the total time is \\(T_1 + T_2\\).\n\nGiven that \\(v_1 = 3\\) mph, the time to walk to your friend's house, \\(T_1\\), is \\(d\/v_1 = d\/3\\).\n\nThe time to run back, \\(T_2\\), is \\(d\/v_2\\).\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip, \\(V_{avg}\\), is \\(\\frac{2d}{T_1 + T_2}\\).\n\nWe want to double the average speed of walking to your friend's house, which is 3 mph. Therefore, we want \\(V_{avg} = 2 \\times 3 = 6\\) mph.\n\nSubstituting \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) into the average speed formula gives us:\n\\[V_{avg} = \\frac{2d}{d\/3 + d\/v_2} = 6\\]\n\nSolving for \\(v_2\\), we get:\n\\[6 = \\frac{2d}{d\/3 + d\/v_2}\\]\n\\[6 = \\frac{2}{1\/3 + 1\/v_2}\\]\n\\[6 = \\frac{6}{1 + 3\/v_2}\\]\n\\[1 + 3\/v_2 = 1\\]\n\nFrom the last step, we see that the equation was simplified incorrectly. Let's correct the approach:\n\n\\[6 = \\frac{2}{1\/3 + 1\/v_2}\\]\n\\[3 = \\frac{1}{1\/3 + 1\/v_2}\\]\n\\[3(1\/3 + 1\/v_2) = 1\\]\n\\[1 + 3\/v_2 = 1\\]\n\nThis step was incorrect. Let's correctly solve for \\(v_2\\) without making algebraic mistakes:\n\n\\[6 = \\frac{2d}{d\/3 + d\/v_2}\\]\n\\[6 = \\frac{2}{1\/3 + 1\/v_2}\\]\n\\[6(1\/3 + 1\/v_2) = 2\\]\n\\[2 + 6\/v_2 = 2\\]\n\nThis approach has led to confusion. Let's simplify the explanation:\n\nTo double the average speed to 6 mph for the entire trip, knowing that the first half was at 3 mph, we need to understand that the average speed of a round trip cannot be simply doubled by doubling the return speed due to the time spent at the slower speed initially. The correct approach involves recognizing that to average 6 mph over the entire distance, the time taken for both legs of the trip must be equal, because speed is a function of distance over time, and we're trying to find a scenario where the average speed is doubled despite the slower first leg.\n\nGiven the mistake in the algebraic manipulation and the explanation, let's directly address the question:\n\nTo double the average speed for the entire trip to 6 mph, considering the initial speed was 3 mph and the fact that doubling the average speed is not as straightforward as doubling the return speed due to the time spent walking, the correct answer reflects a misunderstanding of the problem's requirements for doubling the average speed. The correct approach involves calculating the necessary speed to make the average speed for the entire trip 6 mph, which involves more complex calculations than simply doubling the initial speed.\n\nHowever, the correct answer is derived from understanding that to average 6 mph over a distance where half was traveled at 3 mph, the return trip's speed must compensate for the slower first half in a way that the average speed is 6 mph. This involves calculating based on time, not just doubling the speed.\n\nGiven the confusion in the explanation, let's simplify and correct the conclusion:\n\nThe correct answer is not directly listed due to the mistake in the explanation process. The key is understanding that to achieve an overall average speed of 6 mph, when the first half was at 3 mph, requires considering the total time and distance for both legs of the journey. The calculation involves determining how fast the return leg must be to reduce the overall time to match an average speed of 6 mph for the total distance.\n\nGiven the error in the provided solution steps and to directly address the question without further incorrect algebraic manipulation:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```\n\nThe correct answer is B. Infinitely fast, because to double the average speed of the entire trip after walking the first half at 3 mph, you would have to make the return trip instantaneously, which is theoretically impossible, hence \"infinitely fast.\" This is because the time taken for the first half of the trip at 3 mph has already set a pace that requires an impossible speed to average out to double the speed over the entire distance.","score":""}}
