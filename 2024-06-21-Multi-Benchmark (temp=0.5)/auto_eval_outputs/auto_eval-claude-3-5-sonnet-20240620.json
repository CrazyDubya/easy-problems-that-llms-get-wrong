We have 1000 bottles and 10 prisoners.\n2. We need to identify the poisoned bottle in 24 hours.\n3. The poison takes effect in exactly 24 hours.\n4. We can't rely on taste, as the poison is described as \"very bitter\" but the wine is \"sweet,\" so it might mask the taste.\n\nThe key to solving this efficiently is to use the 10 prisoners as a binary system. Here's how it would work:\n\n1. Assign each bottle a unique binary number from 0 to 999 (which requires 10 bits).\n2. Each prisoner represents one bit in this 10-bit system.\n3. For each bottle, if its binary number has a '1' in a particular position, the corresponding prisoner drinks from that bottle.\n4. After 24 hours, check which prisoners have died. The binary number formed by their deaths (1 for dead, 0 for alive) will identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example:\n- If prisoners 1, 3, and 7 die, the poisoned bottle's binary number is 1010100000, which is bottle number 672.\n\nThis method:\n- Tests all 1000 bottles in one go\n- Uses all 10 prisoners efficiently\n- Provides a definitive answer in exactly 24 hours\n- Doesn't rely on taste\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"107":{"level_0":107,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

When the host asks if you want to switch to Door No. 2, they are effectively combining the probabilities of Doors 2 and 3 into one choice.\n\n4.

If you switch to Door No. 2, your probability of winning increases to 2\/3.\n\nThis scenario is a simplified version of the famous Monty Hall problem.

A pound is a unit of weight, so regardless of the material, one pound of any substance will always weigh exactly one pound.\n\n2. The question asks us to compare:\n   - A pound of water\n   - Two pounds of bricks\n   - A pound of feathers\n   - Three pounds of air\n\n3. While it might seem counterintuitive because of their different volumes or densities, the weight is determined solely by the number of pounds specified:\n   - A pound of water weighs 1 pound\n   - Two pounds of bricks weigh 2 pounds\n   - A pound of feathers weighs 1 pound\n   - Three pounds of air weigh 3 pounds\n\n4. Among these options, the heaviest is three pounds of air, followed by two pounds of bricks. The pound of water and pound of feathers weigh the same (1 pound each).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. Two pounds of brick.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"189":{"level_0":189,"index":10,"category":"Relational","question":"I get out on the top floor (third floor) at street level.

Assign each prisoner a place value in binary: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512.\n2. For each bottle, determine its binary representation using these place values.\n3.

We need to find the fastest way to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nThe key insight here is to realize that we can use the 10 prisoners to represent a binary number system. With 10 prisoners, we can represent 2^10 = 1024 different combinations, which is enough to cover all 1000 bottles.\n\nHere's how it would work:\n\n1. Assign each bottle a unique binary number from 0 to 999.\n2. Each prisoner represents a bit in this 10-bit binary number.\n3.

Let's analyze the situation:\n\n1. We have two doors: one leads to death, one to freedom.\n2. There are two guardians, one by each door.\n3. The taller guardian always tells the truth and guards the death door.\n4. The other guardian always lies.\n\nThe key to solving this puzzle is to ask a question that will give us the correct information regardless of which guardian we ask. We can do this with just one carefully worded question.\n\nThe question we can ask either guardian is: \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\nHere's why this works:\n\n- If we ask the truthful guardian, they will truthfully tell us what the lying guardian would say. The lying guardian would point to the death door, so the truthful guardian would point to the death door.\n\n- If we ask the lying guardian, they will lie about what the truthful guardian would say. The truthful guardian would point to the freedom door, but the lying guardian would say the opposite, again pointing to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the guardian we ask will point to the death door. Therefore, we know that the other door must lead to freedom.\n\nWith this single question, we can determine which door leads to freedom, regardless of which guardian we ask.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the minimum number of questions needed is one.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"285":{"level_0":285,"index":16,"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

We need to minimize the number of prisoners at risk while ensuring we can identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nThe key insight here is to use the prisoners as binary digits. With 10 prisoners, we can represent 2^10 = 1024 different combinations, which is enough to cover all 1000 bottles.\n\nHere's how it would work:\n\n1. Number the bottles from 0 to 999.\n2. Convert each bottle number to its binary representation.\n3. Each prisoner represents a bit in this binary number.\n4. For each bottle, if its binary representation has a '1' in a certain position, the corresponding prisoner drinks from that bottle.\n\nFor example:\n- Bottle 0 = 0000000000 (no one drinks)\n- Bottle 1 = 0000000001 (only prisoner 1 drinks)\n- Bottle 999 = 1111100111 (prisoners 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10 drink)\n\nAfter 24 hours, check which prisoners are affected.

However, this method is unnecessarily complicated and inefficient.\n\nD. Filling the 2-gallon jug, twice:\nThis is the most straightforward and efficient solution. By simply filling the 2-gallon jug twice, we can measure exactly 4 gallons of water using the smallest possible jug and with the fewest steps.\n\nGiven that we have a 4-gallon jug available, we could also directly use that. However, since this option is not listed and the question asks for the most efficient method among the given choices, we should select the best option from those provided.\n\nTherefore, the most efficient method among the given choices is to fill the 2-gallon jug twice.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"297":{"level_0":297,"index":28,"category":"Popular science","question":"A 2kg tree grows in a planted pot with 10kg of soil.

Initially, we have:\n   - A 2kg tree\n   - 10kg of soil\n\n2. The tree grows from 2kg to 3kg, which means it gained 1kg in mass.\n\n3. The key concept here is the conservation of mass. The total mass of the system (tree + soil) should remain constant unless something is added or removed from the outside.\n\n4. Since the tree gained 1kg, this mass must have come from somewhere within the closed system. The only source available is the soil.\n\n5. Therefore, the soil must have lost 1kg of mass to the tree.\n\n6. Initial soil mass: 10kg\n   Soil mass lost to tree growth: 1kg\n   Remaining soil mass: 10kg - 1kg = 9kg\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is 9kg of soil left.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"298":{"level_0":298,"index":29,"category":"Relational","question":"A man steps over a 0.5m hurdle.

If the man's feet just barely clear the top of the hurdle, that would be the minimum height he could have jumped.\n\nGiven these points, the man must jump at least slightly higher than 0.5m to clear the hurdle. If he jumped exactly 0.5m, his feet would hit the top of the hurdle, and he wouldn't clear it.
