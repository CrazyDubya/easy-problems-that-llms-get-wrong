Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"To determine the minimum number of races needed to find the fastest horse out of six, without any additional conditions such as the number of horses that can race at a time being specified, we need to consider the most efficient way to rank them. If we assume that only five horses can race at a time (a common assumption for this type of problem due to track limitations), the solution would unfold as follows:\n\n1. Race all six horses in groups of five to get a sense of their relative speeds within each group. This would take one race for each group, totaling 5 races (but since we have only six horses, we adjust this to fit our scenario). We would need at least one race to see five of them in action. After the first race, we have some information but not complete.\n\n2. We cannot determine the fastest horse in just one race unless all six horses race together, which contradicts our initial assumption of a maximum of five horses per race. With six horses and assuming a maximum of five horses per race, we would need at least two races: one for five horses and another for at least the remaining one horse and any necessary comparisons with the first group's fastest.\n\n3. However, to accurately determine the single fastest horse among all six, we would need additional races beyond just two. After the initial grouping and racing, we would need to race the fastest from each group against each other to determine the overall fastest.\n\nGiven these considerations and without more specific constraints (like the maximum number of horses per race, if races are timed, or if there's direct comparison possible), the answer to the question under most common assumptions (like a 5-horse race limit) would be more than two but not precisely determinable with the information provided. Thus, the correct choice, given the options and common interpretations of this problem, is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```\n\nThis response assumes a scenario with constraints that are typical in puzzle formulations but not explicitly stated in the question. If all six horses could race at once and the only goal is to find the fastest, theoretically, only one race would be needed. However, based on the usual constraints and the nature of the question, \"Unknown\" is the most fitting answer.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"1":{"level_0":1,"index":2,"category":"Puzzle","question":"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a gold bar; behind the others, rotten vegetables.

Initially, when you choose one door out of three, the probability of picking the door with the gold bar is 1\/3, and the probability that the gold bar is behind one of the other two doors is 2\/3. When the host, who knows what's behind all the doors, offers you the chance to switch to door No. 2 after you've picked door No. 1, the probability isn't redistributed evenly among the doors because the host's action of offering a switch is based on knowledge of what's behind each door. \n\nIf the gold bar was behind your initially chosen door (1\/3 chance), switching would lose. However, if the gold bar was not behind your initially chosen door (2\/3 chance), switching would win you the gold bar, because the host effectively removes one losing option by not offering to switch you to a door with rotten vegetables. Therefore, switching to door No. 2 (or the other door not initially chosen, if the numbers were different) gives you a 2\/3 chance of winning, making it the best choice.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"2":{"level_0":2,"index":3,"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"To determine the fastest horse out of six with the least number of races, assuming you can only race five horses at a time (a common constraint in these types of problems), you would proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Race 1-5**: Race the first five horses (let's call them A, B, C, D, and E) to see how they rank against each other. This is your first race.\n2. **Race 6**: Race the sixth horse (let's call this one F) against any four of the previous five horses. This is needed because you have no idea how F compares to the others without racing it. This is your second race.\n   \nHowever, upon further consideration, the initial assumption to race the sixth horse against four others in the second race doesn't directly align with the goal of finding the fastest horse in the minimum number of races. Instead, the strategy should focus on how to effectively use each race to compare the horses' speeds. Let's correct the approach:\n\n1. **Race 1**: Race five of the horses (A, B, C, D, E).\n2. **Race 2**: Race the remaining horse (F) with four of the horses that raced in the first race, but this strategy doesn't optimize the process of finding the fastest horse. \n\nRevising the strategy:\n\n1. **Race the horses in groups of 5**: Since you have only six horses, you could theoretically race five in the first race and the sixth in a separate scenario. However, this doesn't help in directly comparing all six horses unless you have a way to accurately measure their race times and can compare those times across races, which isn't implied in the typical version of this problem.\n\n2. **The actual optimal strategy** without timekeeping involves arranging races to directly compare the horses against each other. The correct strategy involves grouping and elimination:\n\n- **Race 1-3**: You race the horses in groups of three (if only three can race at a time, which isn't specified but let's consider more common constraints), which would mean two races to see all six horses race at least once. However, this doesn't directly solve the problem as we're looking for the minimum number of races without assumptions on race size limitations beyond the initial five-horse constraint.\n\nGiven the typical constraints of these problems (racing five at a time and wanting to find the fastest without direct time comparisons), the correct approach involves:\n\n- **Race 1**: Race five horses.\n- **Race 2**: Race the remaining horse against some of the previously raced horses or in a strategy that helps determine its speed relative to the others, but this second race doesn't directly compare it to all five from the first race effectively under usual constraints.\n\nFor a direct comparison and finding the fastest horse with minimal assumptions:\n\n- **Race 1**: Race five horses.\n- **Race 2**: Assuming you can directly compare all horses' speeds somehow (either through a direct race or timekeeping), you could theoretically determine the fastest among all six by racing the sixth against any of the first five and using previous race results to infer rankings.\n\nHowever, to accurately rank all six horses directly against each other without specific time measurements but under a constraint where all must be compared to find the absolute fastest, you need a strategy that ensures each horse's speed is directly compared under equal conditions.\n\nGiven the standard constraints and goals:\n\n- **Race 1**: Race five horses.\n- **Race 2**: Race the remaining horse in a way that directly compares it to others, but this alone doesn't solve the problem under usual constraints.\n\nThe correct approach for the least number of races to find the fastest, assuming no direct time comparison and that each horse needs to be raced to be ranked, would typically involve a series of elimination races and then final races to directly compare the top contenders. This would be more than two races and requires a detailed strategy based on how the first races' results inform the subsequent ones.\n\nGiven the constraints and typical problem-solving approaches for these scenarios, the answer provided earlier was incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the problem's constraints and the goal of minimizing races to find the fastest horse directly. \n\nReevaluating the initial question with the typical constraints in mind (racing five horses at a time and finding the fastest among six), the minimum number of races needed to definitively find the fastest horse, assuming you cannot directly compare race times across different races, involves a strategy that wasn't accurately described in the initial explanation.\n\nThe correct minimum number of races to find the fastest horse, under common interpretations of this problem where you can only race five horses at a time and want to find the fastest, typically involves more complex strategies than just two races and cannot be accurately determined without more specific constraints or assumptions on how the races inform each other.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the standard approach to these types of logical problems without additional constraints or assumptions (like time measurements or specific racing strategies that allow for direct speed comparisons across races), would actually be more complex than the initial response suggested. Given the standard puzzle format and typical constraints, the minimum number of races needed to definitively find the fastest horse out of six, without direct time comparisons, is not accurately reflected in the initial choices provided.\n\nRevisiting the problem with the correct understanding and typical constraints, the question seems to be aiming for a logical puzzle solution that isn't directly answered by the options given, as the puzzle usually involves more nuanced strategies for direct comparison.\n\nGiven the typical constraints and the goal of the question, and correcting for the misunderstanding in the initial explanation:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```\n\nThe rationale behind this choice is that, based on the information provided and common constraints of such problems, the actual minimum number of races depends on specific details about the racing conditions (e.g., if races can directly compare all horses' speeds or if there's a way to measure and compare times across races) that aren't specified.

However, after the opponent fires at himself and no bullet comes out, it means one of the empty chambers was selected. Without spinning, there are now 5 bullets in 5 chambers and 1 empty chamber already played, so the chance of hitting a bullet if you do not spin is 5\/5 (or 100%) because you're set to fire next without re-randomizing the chamber positions. But, considering the initial scenario before the opponent's turn, there's a misunderstanding in the explanation provided. If the chamber is not spun again, the actual scenario is that you have a 5\/6 chance of hitting a bullet because one of the bullets did not fire, leaving 5 chambers, one of which is empty and the rest have bullets. Spinning the chamber again would reset the odds to 5\/6, not altering your chances of survival. The correct reasoning is that without spinning, you face a 5\/6 chance (not 5\/5 as mistakenly explained), because one of the chambers is now known to be empty and won't come up again if you don't spin. Spinning again would indeed reset the chances to 5\/6, which are the same odds you face without spinning after the initial trigger pull resulted in no bullet being fired. The mistake was in the explanation of the odds after the trigger pull without spinning. The correct choice should reflect the understanding that not spinning does not change your odds from the initial setup, which are 5\/6. Therefore, the choice indicating whether spinning makes a difference or not in terms of changing your odds was incorrectly justified. The initial logic provided was flawed, leading to an incorrect conclusion. The accurate assessment should consider that not spinning keeps the odds the same as initially faced, which are 5\/6, not 5\/5 or 100%.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"33":{"level_0":33,"index":4,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

Also, when two people cross together, they will move at the speed of the slower person. The goal is to minimize the total time taken for all four to cross.\n\n1. First, have A and B cross the bridge together, taking 2 minutes (since B is slower). \n2. A then returns with the torch, taking 1 minute, totaling 3 minutes so far.\n3. C and D, the slowest, cross together. This takes 10 minutes, as D is the slowest. Now, we're at 13 minutes.\n4. B returns with the torch to A and B, taking 2 minutes. This adds up to 15 minutes.\n5. Finally, A and B cross again, taking 2 minutes, totaling 17 minutes.\n\nHowever, there's a faster way:\n\n1. A and B cross first, taking 2 minutes.\n2. A returns, taking 1 minute, for a total of 3 minutes.\n3. C and D then cross, taking 10 minutes, for a total of 13 minutes.\n4. B returns with the torch, taking 2 minutes, for a total of 15 minutes.\n5. A and B cross again, taking 2 minutes.\n\nThis totals 17 minutes, but there's an optimization mistake in my explanation. Let's correct that and find the optimal solution:\n\n1. **First**, send A and B across, taking 2 minutes.\n2. **Then**, A comes back with the torch, taking 1 minute, totaling 3 minutes.\n3. **Next**, send C and D across, the slowest, which takes 10 minutes. Now, we're at 13 minutes.\n4. **Finally**, B comes back with the torch, taking 2 minutes, totaling 15 minutes.\n5. A and B cross again, taking 2 minutes, which was mistakenly added in the previous calculation.\n\nThe correct steps are:\n\n1. A and B cross (2 minutes), A goes back (1 minute) = 3 minutes.\n2. C and D cross (10 minutes), B goes back (2 minutes) = 12 minutes.\n3. A and B cross again (2 minutes).\n\nSo, the total is 3 minutes (first step) + 12 minutes (second and third steps combined) = 17 minutes. This was a mistake in the explanation process. The correct minimal strategy actually sums up as follows:\n\n1. A and B cross (2 minutes), A goes back (1 minute) = 3 minutes.\n2. C and D cross (10 minutes), B goes back (2 minutes) = 12 minutes total for this step.\n3. A and B cross again (2 minutes).\n\nSo the correct minimal time is not 17 but rather:\n\n1. Send A and B first: 2 minutes.\n2. A returns: +1 minute = 3 minutes.\n3. Send C and D: +10 minutes = 13 minutes.\n4. B returns: +2 minutes = 15 minutes.\n5. A and B cross again: +2 minutes = 17 minutes.\n\nHowever, the mistake in recounting the steps shows a misunderstanding in optimizing the sequence. The correct sequence indeed results in the fastest time of **17 minutes**, but my explanation initially included an incorrect recount of the steps. The correct explanation is:\n\n1. A and B cross first (taking 2 minutes), and A returns (1 minute).\n2. C and D cross together (taking 10 minutes), and B returns (2 minutes).\n3. Finally, A and B cross again (taking 2 minutes).\n\nThis results in a total of 17 minutes, but through a different understanding of the steps involved, which was corrected in the final recount.\n\nGiven this correction and the final understanding:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"44":{"level_0":44,"index":15,"category":"Puzzle","question":"You're in a room with two doors that lead out.

Assuming we can only race 5 horses at a time (a common constraint in these types of problems), we need to strategize on how to minimize the number of races while still ensuring we can definitively determine the fastest horse.\n\n1. **First Race (5 horses)**: Race five of the horses. This leaves one horse out, but gives us a preliminary ranking of the five horses that raced.\n\n2. **Second Race (the remaining 1 horse + 4 new horses)**: Race the remaining horse with four of the horses that have already raced. However, this approach doesn't optimize the process because we're not gaining maximum new information. Instead, we should race the remaining horse not yet raced against four others in a different configuration to maximize information gain. But, to ensure we find the fastest horse in the minimum number of races, we don't mix the horses like this. We proceed differently:\n\n    - **Second Race (the remaining 1 horse)**: This is not a practical step since racing one horse won't give us new information compared to others. So, the actual step after the first race is to race the 6th horse in a meaningful way, which usually involves comparing it against others directly or indirectly.\n\nGiven the mistake in the second step's explanation, let's correct the course of action:\n\n1. **First Race (5 horses)**: We race five of the horses to get a preliminary ranking among them.\n2. **Second Race (the remaining horse + selection)**: The optimal strategy involves using the results from the first race to inform the selection of horses in subsequent races. However, to determine the fastest horse with the least number of races without any assumptions (like time trials or direct comparisons in every possible combination), we need a better strategy.\n\nA correct approach would involve:\n- **First Race**: Race five of the horses.\n- **Second Race**: Race the remaining horse with some of the previously raced horses to establish its relative speed.\n- **Third Race and beyond**: Depending on the outcomes and if we can only race 5 at a time, we need at least one more race to directly or indirectly compare the top speeds of the horses, especially if the 6th horse is potentially faster than some from the first race.\n\nHowever, the correct strategy, assuming we can only race 5 horses at a time and there's no way to measure their speed other than relative placement in races, involves more detailed logic to ensure all horses are fairly compared. The initial assumption here oversimplified the process.\n\nThe actual minimum number of races to definitively determine the fastest horse, without any timing devices, just by order of finish, and assuming we can only race 5 horses at a time, would generally be more than three due to the need to compare the fastest horses in different configurations to ensure a fair assessment. But, given the options and the common mistake in the initial logic, the correct minimum isn't directly listed in the provided choices.\n\nGiven the constraints and typical puzzle logic associated with these types of problems (and the common mistake in the explanation), the aim is to find the fastest horse in the least number of races, which often involves a series of elimination races and a final race to determine the fastest among the top contenders. The standard approach to this problem, considering all logistical constraints and aiming to minimize races, involves more nuanced strategies than those outlined in the simplistic steps above.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the common interpretation of this puzzle (and correcting for the misstep in the explanation), aiming for the least number of races to find the fastest horse with only 5 horses racing at a time, is not accurately reflected in the provided options. The typical answer involves grouping the horses into races, then racing the winners (and possibly other key horses based on their finishes) to determine the fastest overall.\n\nGiven the misunderstanding and misapplication of the strategy in the explanation, and since the exact minimum isn't directly provided in the options but the explanation aimed to simplify the process:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```\n\nThis answer reflects that the provided explanation and strategy did not accurately capture the correct methodology for determining the fastest horse with the minimum number of races under typical constraints.

Assuming a racing track can accommodate all six horses in a single race, we could theoretically find out the fastest horse in just one race. However, the question seems to imply a desire to rank all six horses from fastest to slowest, not just to find the fastest one.\n\nIf we're limited to racing a subset of the horses against each other at one time (a common assumption in similar puzzles is a maximum of five horses per race due to track limitations, but this specific limitation isn't stated here), we would need a strategy to minimize races while still determining a complete ranking.\n\nA common approach to solve this puzzle (assuming a 5-horse race limit) is:\n\n1. Race all six horses in groups of five (Race 1 and Race 2), leaving one horse out of the first two races. This step doesn't apply directly here since we can assume all six can race at once, but it's part of explaining the thought process in a more constrained scenario.\n\n2. Race the top three horses from each of the first two races against each other to determine the overall fastest (Race 3). This would be the next logical step if we were following the constraint of a maximum of five horses per race. However, it's unnecessary if all six horses can race at once.\n\nGiven the assumption that all six horses can race together (as the question does not specify a limit on the number of horses per race), the minimum number of races needed to determine the fastest horse (without needing to rank all six from fastest to slowest) would indeed be just one. However, if the goal is to rank all six from fastest to slowest, one race is insufficient because it only gives relative speed for that single race, without a way to measure exact differences or account for variables like lane position or day-to-day performance variations.\n\nWithout additional constraints or the need to fully rank all horses from fastest to slowest with absolute certainty, the answer focusing solely on finding the fastest horse, under the assumption all can race at once, would be:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```\n\nThis answer assumes the question is asking for the minimum number of races to determine the fastest horse under the condition that all horses can race together.

Here's the breakdown of the situation:\n\n1. You initially choose a door (let's say door No.1).\n2. The host, who knows what's behind each door, gives you the opportunity to switch your choice to another unopened door (in this case, suggesting door No.2).\n\nThe key insight is that when you made your initial choice, there was a 1\/3 chance of picking the door with the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance that the gold bar was behind one of the other two doors.\n\nWhen the host offers you the chance to switch doors, if the gold bar was behind one of the other doors (a 2\/3 chance), switching would win you the gold bar. The host's action of offering another door (without revealing any new information directly) effectively consolidates the probability of the two doors you didn't pick into the one he offers you the chance to switch to.\n\nTherefore, switching doors (to door No.2 in this scenario) would give you a 2\/3 chance of winning the gold bar, whereas sticking with your original choice (door No.1) leaves you with the original 1\/3 chance.\n\nHowever, the question seems slightly misleading by asking if you want to pick door No.2 instead, without mentioning what happens to door No.3 or whether the host has revealed what's behind door No.3. The Monty Hall problem typically involves the host revealing one of the non-chosen doors to show it doesn't contain the prize, then offering the chance to switch to the remaining closed door.\n\nSince the question doesn't specify that the host has revealed a door with rotten vegetables before asking if you want to switch to door No.2, it deviates from the classic Monty Hall setup. But, assuming it follows the logic of the Monty Hall problem and the host's question is part of a strategy to get you to switch based on that logic, the best choice would still be to switch doors, because the initial logic of the Monty Hall problem applies regardless of which door you're offered to switch to, assuming one of the non-chosen doors has been implicitly accounted for by the host's knowledge and strategy.\n\nGiven the typical interpretation of the Monty Hall problem, the best choice is to switch doors, but since the question doesn't specify that door No.3 has been shown to not contain the prize or is implicitly out of contention, and the question directly asks about the advantage of picking door No.2, the answer would be:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```\n\nThis answer assumes the reader understands the Monty Hall problem context, where switching doors (to the one offered by the host) generally provides a better chance of winning based on the host's actions suggesting an advantageous switch, even though the question's phrasing doesn't perfectly align with the classic problem's setup.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"92":{"level_0":92,"index":3,"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

After spinning, the probability of landing on a chamber with a bullet is 5\/6.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again:\n- Since the first trigger pull resulted in no bullet being fired, we know that the bullet was not in the first chamber. This leaves 5 possible chambers where the bullet could be, but since 5 of these chambers contain bullets, the probability of the next chamber (in line to be fired) containing a bullet is 5\/5 or 100%.\n\nHowever, my explanation above mistakenly assumes a scenario where there's only one bullet, affecting the calculation for not spinning. Let's correct that oversight and analyze the scenario correctly.\n\nIn the actual scenario given, with 5 bullets loaded and the first trigger pull resulting in no bullet being fired, we know one chamber out of the remaining five must be empty, and the other four contain bullets.\n\nIf you do not spin the chambers again:\n- The first trigger pull was on an empty chamber. There are now 5 chambers left, 4 of which are loaded. So, if you do not spin, the probability of hitting a loaded chamber is 4\/5 or 80%.\n\nIf you spin the chambers again:\n- The probability resets to having a 5\/6 chance of hitting a loaded chamber since all chambers are equally likely to come up, including the one empty chamber.\n\nGiven this correct analysis, it's clear that not spinning gives you a slightly better chance of survival because the probability of hitting an empty chamber is higher if you do not spin (1\/5 chance of an empty chamber if you don't spin versus 1\/6 if you do).\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"93":{"level_0":93,"index":4,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

However, the twist here involves pairs of twins, which changes the dynamics of the original problem.\n\nIn the traditional birthday problem, the answer is 23 people, which gives just over a 50% chance that at least two people share the same birthday. This is not intuitive to many, as it seems like you would need more people for a 50% chance of a shared birthday.\n\nBut, when we consider pairs of twins, the situation is different. Twins share the same birthday, so the question becomes: How many pairs of twins do you need for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people (not from the same pair of twins) have the same birthday?\n\nGiven that each pair of twins has the same birthday, each pair counts as only one unique birthday in terms of calculating the probability. Thus, the question essentially reduces back to the original birthday problem but with the understanding that each \"person\" in this scenario represents a pair of twins with the same birthday.\n\nTherefore, you still only need 23 pairs of twins in the room to have at least a 50% chance that two pairs of twins share the same birthday (which means any two people from those pairs). This is because each pair of twins is considered as one \"birthday\" in the calculation, and the math of the birthday problem doesn't change whether those birthdays represent single individuals or pairs of twins.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"114":{"level_0":114,"index":25,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.

Since the classic birthday problem states that you need 23 people for a greater than 50% chance that two share a birthday, having 12 pairs (which equals 24 people) would also exceed the threshold needed for a 50% chance that two individuals share the same birthday.

If the hotel is partially full, it means there are guests in some of the rooms, but there are still infinitely many empty rooms available. To accommodate one more guest, the simplest solution without specifying the current occupancy details is to ask each current guest to move to the next room (e.g., from room 1 to room 2, from room 2 to room 3, and so on). This action creates a vacancy in the first room (room 1), which can then accommodate the new guest.

If you fill the 5-gallon jug and pour it into the 4-gallon jug, you would indeed be left with exactly 1 gallon in the 5-gallon jug.

Pouring the remaining 2 gallons into an empty 3-gallon jug and refilling the 5-gallon jug to then fill the 3-gallon jug (which already contains 2 gallons) will leave you with 4 gallons in the 5-gallon jug. This method effectively measures exactly 4 gallons by using the jugs to measure and transfer water until the desired amount is obtained. However, the explanation provided in this option is slightly off because it implies doing the 3-gallon pour twice without the necessary steps in between to achieve the 4 gallons in a straightforward manner.\n\nD.

Assuming you can only race a maximum of five horses at a time (a common restriction in such puzzles), here's a breakdown of the logic:\n\n1. **First Race (5 horses)**: Race five out of the six horses. This race will determine the fastest among these five, but we still don't know how the sixth horse compares to these, nor the order of all the horses.\n2. **Second Race (the 6th horse + 4 other horses)**: You could introduce the sixth horse in a race with four of the horses from the first race, but this still wouldn't definitively rank all six horses from fastest to slowest without further races.\n3. **Additional Races**: To accurately determine the fastest horse, you would need to consider various scenarios where the horses are raced against each other in different combinations to establish a clear ranking. Just racing all once wouldn't suffice because you have to account for the relative speed among all the horses, not just those in any single race.\n\nGiven this, the minimum number of races needed to definitively find the fastest horse, without additional constraints or technologies (like time tracking to compare race times across different heats), would require a strategy that involves more than just one or two races. The key is not just finding the fastest but doing so with the least number of races.\n\nA typical strategy involves racing the horses in groups and then racing the top horses against each other. However, the exact number of races depends on specific rules (like if you can race all six at once or only five at a time, and if you're looking to find just the fastest or to rank them all). \n\nWithout more specific constraints (like the ability to race all six horses at once or only being interested in the single fastest horse without needing a complete ranking), and assuming you can't race all six at once:\n\n- You'd race five horses, then race the remaining one against some of the previously raced horses to start establishing a ranking. But to definitively know the fastest with all variables considered (and not just find a potentially fastest horse through happenstance), you'd typically need a series of races that involves strategic grouping and re-racing.\n\nGiven the complexity and the need for a strategic approach that wasn't fully detailed in the options (like racing in groups and then having a final of winners to find the fastest), the correct choice based on the provided options and considering a standard approach to such problems would be:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```\n\nThis answer reflects that without more specific details on the racing conditions (e.g., maximum number of horses per race, whether times can be compared across races, or if there's a need to find the absolute fastest or just the relative fastest in smaller groups), it's difficult to pinpoint the exact minimum number of races with the information given.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"151":{"level_0":151,"index":2,"category":"Puzzle","question":"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a gold bar; behind the others, rotten vegetables.

This is because the goat can't be left with the cabbage or the wolf without supervision.\n   - Crossings so far: 1\n\n2. The farmer goes back alone to the original side to get either the wolf or the cabbage. Let's say he takes the wolf next.\n   - Crossings so far: 2\n\n3. The farmer leaves the wolf on the other side but takes the goat back with him to the original side. This prevents the wolf from eating the goat.\n   - Crossings so far: 3\n\n4. The farmer then takes the cabbage across the river, leaving it with the wolf. The wolf doesn't eat cabbage, so this is safe.\n   - Crossings so far: 4\n\n5. Finally, the farmer returns alone to the original side to take the goat across. Now, all three items - the goat, the wolf, and the cabbage - are safely on the other side of the river.\n   - Crossings so far: 5\n\nThus, the minimum number of crossings the farmer needs to make to get the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage across the river without anything being eaten is five.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"184":{"level_0":184,"index":5,"category":"Puzzle","question":"Bob has three boxes in front of him - Box A, Box B and Box C.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"To solve this problem, let's denote the distance to the friend's house as \\(d\\) miles. Since the speed walking to the friend's house is 3mph, the time taken for this trip, \\(t_1\\), can be calculated as \\(d \/ 3\\) hours.\n\nLet \\(v\\) be the speed (in mph) at which one has to run back to double the average speed for the entire trip. The time taken for the return trip, \\(t_2\\), is \\(d \/ v\\) hours.\n\nThe total distance of the round trip is \\(2d\\) miles, and the total time is \\(t_1 + t_2 = d\/3 + d\/v\\) hours. The average speed for the entire trip, \\(S_{avg}\\), is the total distance divided by the total time, which gives:\n\\[S_{avg} = \\frac{2d}{d\/3 + d\/v} = \\frac{2d}{(d(3+v))\/(3v)} = \\frac{6v}{3+v}\\]\n\nWe want this average speed to be twice the walking speed, i.e., \\(2 \\times 3\\) mph = 6 mph. Substituting \\(S_{avg}\\) with 6 mph gives us:\n\\[6 = \\frac{6v}{3+v}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(v\\) gives:\n\\[6(3+v) = 6v\\]\n\\[18 + 6v = 6v\\]\n\nThis equation simplifies to \\(18 = 0\\), which is a contradiction, indicating a mistake in the manipulation. The correct step to find \\(v\\) after setting up the equation \\(\\frac{6v}{3+v} = 6\\) should be:\n\n\\[6 = \\frac{6v}{3+v}\\]\nMultiplying both sides by \\(3+v\\) to clear the denominator:\n\\[6(3+v) = 6v\\]\n\\[18 + 6v = 6v\\]\n\nTo correctly solve for \\(v\\), we should have set up the equation to solve for doubling the average speed correctly. Let's correct the approach:\n\nWe want the average speed over the entire trip to be twice the speed of the first leg, which means the average speed should be \\(2 \\times 3\\) mph = 6 mph. However, we've misinterpreted how to apply this to find \\(v\\). The correct approach is to understand that if the average speed of the entire trip is to be doubled from the initial speed of 3 mph, it should be 6 mph, but we need to correctly calculate the speed \\(v\\) to achieve this.\n\nFor the entire trip (both ways) to average 6 mph, the time taken for both legs of the trip must fit the definition of averaging 6 mph over the total distance. However, we realize we've made a mistake in our setup and solution path. Let's correct the logic:\n\nTo double the average speed for the entire trip to \\(2 \\times 3\\) mph = 6 mph, we need to consider how the average speed is calculated over the total distance and total time. The mistake was in the algebraic manipulation and the interpretation of how to achieve the doubled average speed. \n\nGiven the confusion and errors in solving, let's directly address the question with the correct reasoning, bypassing the incorrect algebraic manipulation:\n\nTo actually double the average speed for the entire trip to 6 mph considering the walking speed is 3 mph for one way, we look at the premise that the average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. If the speed to the friend's house is 3 mph, and we want the average speed for the round trip to be 6 mph, we essentially want the round trip to take the same amount of time it would take at a constant speed of 6 mph. However, the premise of doubling the average speed to 6 mph by running back at a specific speed is flawed without correctly calculating the necessary speed. \n\nGiven the confusion in the explanation and realizing the mistake in the algebraic approach, let's clarify with the correct insight:\n\nDoubling the overall average speed is not straightforwardly achieved by doubling the speed on the return trip alone due to the non-linear relationship between speed, distance, and time. The correct answer involves a more nuanced calculation, which was not correctly outlined.\n\nThe correct approach is to realize that to average a certain speed over a given distance, the time taken is crucial. If you walk at 3 mph to some place and want to average 6 mph for the entire trip, you would have to make the return trip instantaneously or \"infinitely fast\" because any time spent on the return trip would lower the average speed below the target of 6 mph for the entire distance.\n\nGiven this realization, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```\nThis answer reflects the understanding that to double the average speed of the entire trip to 6 mph, considering half of the trip was made at 3 mph, the return trip would theoretically have to take no time, implying an infinite speed.","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"210":{"level_0":210,"index":1,"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have six horses and want to race them to see which is fastest.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"To determine the minimum number of races needed to rank six horses by speed without any timing devices, we must use a process of elimination and comparison.\n\nAssuming you can only race five horses at a time (which is a common assumption in these types of problems due to track limitations), you cannot determine the order of all six horses in a single race. Therefore, D is not a possibility.\n\nWith one race, you can only determine the relative speed of five horses, leaving the sixth horse's speed unknown in relation to the others. So, A is not possible.\n\nWith two races (racing five horses in the first race and the sixth in the second race), you still wouldn't have a complete comparison among all horses. You could potentially have the fastest of the first five compete against the sixth in the second race, but you wouldn't have a full ranking without additional races. So, A is not the answer.\n\nThe minimum strategy involves more than just two races because, after the initial race of five horses, you have to find a way to rank the remaining horse relative to those already raced, and then further races to accurately determine the overall ranking.\n\nThe most efficient strategy without additional constraints (like racing five at a time) and assuming you need to find the absolute fastest horse (and not the complete ranking order) involves grouping the horses into sets and racing them in such a way that minimizes the number of races. A common approach is to race the horses in groups and then race the winners (and potentially other key placements) against each other to determine the overall fastest. This would take more than three races to establish a complete ranking from fastest to slowest.\n\nHowever, the question seems to be asking for the complete ranking, which would indeed require a more complex strategy involving at least several races to ensure every horse is compared adequately against the others. This would typically involve racing the horses in groups, then taking the top horses from each group and racing them against each other, and possibly additional races to sort out the middle and lower rankings.\n\nGiven the typical assumptions and aiming for the complete order, the answer cannot be determined precisely with the information provided (e.g., racing all six against each other directly is not an option mentioned, and detailed strategies to achieve the ranking with minimal races depend on specific conditions not stated in the question). Therefore, the correct choice, given the options and assuming the question aims for a precise answer under typical puzzle assumptions, would be:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```\n\nThis response is based on the assumption that we're looking for a precise minimum under standard puzzle conditions, which usually limit the number of horses per race and require direct comparisons to determine ranking.

Here's the rationale:\n\n1. Initially, the probability of choosing the door with the gold bar is 1\/3, and the probability that one of the other two doors has the gold bar is 2\/3.\n2. When you choose a door (say No. 1), and the host, who knows what's behind each door, offers you the chance to switch to another door (say No. 2), the host is effectively giving you the option to stick with your initial 1\/3 chance or switch to a 2\/3 chance. This is because if the gold bar is behind one of the doors you didn't pick (which has a 2\/3 probability), the host has to avoid revealing it, thus offering you a switch essentially consolidates the 2\/3 chance on the door offered if you switch.\n3. The host's question to switch to door No. 2 doesn't change the probabilities but reveals that switching is always to your advantage based on the initial setup. The confusion often arises because it feels counterintuitive that the act of revealing a door (without the prize) and offering a switch changes the probability, but it does by consolidating the non-chosen options' probability into the offered switch.\n\nGiven this explanation:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```\n\nChoosing door No. 2 (or any door offered as an alternative to your initial choice) gives you the biggest advantage because it effectively gives you a 2\/3 chance of winning, as opposed to sticking with your initial 1\/3 chance.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'C'}","json_answer_letter":"C","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"212":{"level_0":212,"index":3,"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

This leaves us with a known empty chamber (the one that was just used) and five potential chambers that could contain the bullets. However, because the gun did not fire, we know that the next chamber in the sequence (given the revolver rotates clockwise and you fire immediately without spinning) must also be empty or else the gun would have fired. This means that out of the five chambers that were not known to be empty before the trigger was pulled, there are now four chambers with bullets and one empty chamber that will rotate into position when you pull the trigger.\n\nIf you choose not to spin the chambers again, you have a 1\/5 chance of hitting the empty chamber and a 4\/5 chance of hitting a bullet.\n\nIf you choose to spin the chambers again, the probability resets to the original state where any of the 5 bullets could be in the chamber that fires next, giving you a 5\/6 chance of hitting a bullet and a 1\/6 chance of hitting the empty chamber.\n\nTherefore, the probability of survival is higher if you do not spin the chambers again (1\/5 chance of dying if you don't spin versus a 5\/6 chance of dying if you do spin).\n\nThe correct choice is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"213":{"level_0":213,"index":4,"category":"Puzzle","question":"A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage.

The key is that the farmer can only leave the wolf alone with the goat if the farmer is present, otherwise, the wolf will eat the goat. Similarly, the goat cannot be left alone with the cabbage without the farmer, or the goat will eat the cabbage. Given the constraints and the fact that the boat has three secure separate compartments, which suggests the farmer can transport all three (the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage) at the same time if needed but must manage who is left behind on each shore to prevent any of the items being eaten.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution that minimizes the number of crossings:\n\n1. The farmer takes the goat across the river first, leaving the wolf and the cabbage on the initial shore. This is because leaving the wolf with the cabbage does not pose a risk.\n   - Crossings: 1\n\n2. The farmer returns alone to the original shore to pick up either the wolf or the cabbage. Let's say he takes the wolf next.\n   - Crossings: 2\n\n3. The farmer leaves the wolf on the other side but takes the goat back with him to the original shore. This prevents the wolf from eating the goat while he's gone.\n   - Crossings: 3\n\n4. The farmer then takes the cabbage across the river, leaving it with the wolf. Since the wolf won't eat the cabbage, this is safe.\n   - Crossings: 4\n\n5. Finally, the farmer returns to the original shore to pick up the goat.\n   - Crossings: 5\n\nGiven this strategy, the minimum number of crossings needed to bring all three across the river safely, without anything being eaten, is 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer in JSON format is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"214":{"level_0":214,"index":5,"category":"Puzzle","question":"Bob has three boxes in front of him - Box A, Box B and Box C.

Therefore, the equation for the total trip time to achieve this average speed is \\(\\frac{2D}{6} = \\frac{D}{3}\\) hours, which is the same as the time taken to walk to the friend's house.\n\nHowever, this calculation of \\(\\frac{D}{3}\\) hours as the total time means that to double the average speed for the entire trip, the return trip would have to take no time at all, which is impossible. Therefore, to actually achieve an average speed of 6 mph for the entire trip, where the trip to the friend's house already takes \\(\\frac{D}{3}\\) hours at 3 mph, the return trip would need to be instantaneous. This is an impossibility, as it would require infinite speed.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"240":{"level_0":240,"index":1,"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have six horses and want to race them to see which is fastest.

Simply racing them all at once would indeed determine the fastest, but that's assuming you have the capability to race all six horses at the same time. If we're considering a scenario where you can only race a subset of them at a time (which is a common puzzle scenario), the strategy changes.\n\nLet's assume you can only race 5 horses at a time (a common limitation in such puzzles), and you want to find the fastest horse in the minimum number of races without any timing devices.\n\n1. **Race 1-5**: Race the first five horses (let's call them A, B, C, D, and E) to see how they rank against each other.\n2. **Race 6**: Race the sixth horse (F) against four of the previously raced horses to see where it fits within the rankings. This step is actually more nuanced in practice because the strategy of which horses to race against F to determine its rank with the fewest races can vary.\n\nHowever, the premise of finding the absolute fastest horse in just one race is possible if all six horses are raced against each other at the same time. This is the simplest and most direct method to determine the fastest horse without any constraints on the number of horses that can race simultaneously.\n\nGiven this, the correct choice, assuming the capability to race all six horses at once, is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```\n\nThis answer assumes the question implies a scenario where all horses can be raced together, which is the only way to definitively determine the fastest horse in a single race.","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'A'}","json_answer_letter":"A","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"241":{"level_0":241,"index":2,"category":"Puzzle","question":"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a gold bar; behind the others, rotten vegetables.

The host's question doesn't change the initial probabilities. The gold bar still has a 1\/3 chance of being behind the door you initially chose (No. 1) and a 2\/3 chance of being behind one of the other two doors. Since one of the other doors would have been eliminated as an option (either because the host opens it to reveal rotten vegetables or implies it's not a choice worth considering), switching doors (to door No. 2 in this scenario) effectively gives you the combined probability of the two doors you didn't initially pick, which remains 2\/3.\n\nThe confusion often arises because it seems like the host's offer to switch doors creates a 50\/50 situation, but it doesn't.

If you walk to your friend's house at 3mph and want to double the average speed for the entire trip, your average speed for both going and coming back needs to be 6mph, since 3mph (walking speed) * 2 = 6mph (target average speed for the entire trip).\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\(v_w = 3\\) mph (walking speed)\n- \\(v_r\\) = running speed (which we need to find)\n- \\(d\\) = distance to your friend's house\n- \\(t_w = \\frac{d}{v_w}\\) = time taken to walk to your friend's house\n- \\(t_r = \\frac{d}{v_r}\\) = time taken to run back home\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip, \\(V_{avg}\\), is the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance for the round trip is \\(2d\\), and the total time is \\(t_w + t_r\\).\n\nWe're aiming for an average speed of 6mph, so:\n\\[V_{avg} = \\frac{2d}{t_w + t_r} = 6\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(t_w\\) and \\(t_r\\) with their respective formulas:\n\\[6 = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{3} + \\frac{d}{v_r}}\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\\[6 = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d(3 + v_r)}{3v_r}}\\]\n\\[6 = \\frac{6v_r}{3 + v_r}\\]\n\\[18v_r = 6(3 + v_r)\\]\n\\[18v_r = 18 + 6v_r\\]\n\\[12v_r = 18\\]\n\\[v_r = \\frac{3}{2}\\]\n\nIt seems there was a mistake in the simplification process. Let's correct it:\n\n\\[6 = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{3} + \\frac{d}{v_r}}\\]\n\\[6 = \\frac{6v_r}{3 + v_r}\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\((3 + v_r)\\) to eliminate the denominator and then by \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) to solve for \\(v_r\\), we get:\n\\[6(3 + v_r) = 6v_r\\]\n\\[18 + 6v_r = 6v_r\\]\n\nThis equation was incorrectly simplified. Let's correctly approach the problem from the concept that to double the average speed for the entire trip, the return speed must be infinitely fast. This is because the time taken for the return journey must be 0 to have no effect on the average speed calculation, which is not achievable in reality.

Assuming we can only race a limited number of horses together (for example, 5 horses in a race due to track limitations, which is a common constraint in such problems), we cannot determine the fastest horse in just one race if all six cannot run together.\n\n1. In the first race, we could race five of the horses, but we would still not know how the sixth horse compares to these five.\n2. If we race the remaining horse against any of the horses from the first race in a second race, we still wouldn't have a complete comparison among all six horses.\n3. To ensure we know the fastest, we could then think about racing the top horses from each of these races, but given the constraint and the need to compare each horse to find the absolute fastest, we're not following the most efficient strategy.\n\nThe most efficient strategy without assuming any constraints on the number of horses per race (since none were specified in the question) would be:\n\n- Race all six horses against each other in one race if there are no limitations on the number of horses per race.

Here's the breakdown:\n\n- Initially, the probability of the gold bar being behind any of the doors is 1\/3.\n- You pick a door, let's say No. 1. The probability of the gold bar being behind door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability of it being behind doors No. 2 or No. 3 combined is 2\/3.\n- The host, who knows what's behind each door, asks if you want to switch to door No. 2. This is a trick to the original problem where usually, the host would open one of the doors you didn't pick to show it's a losing option and then ask if you'd like to switch to the remaining unopened door.\n\nThe key insight to the Monty Hall problem is that switching doors (to the door not initially picked and not revealed by the host) increases your probability of winning the gold bar to 2\/3, because the host's action of asking if you want to switch (or in the classic problem, revealing a losing door) gives you additional information.\n\nHowever, in this variation, the host directly asks if you want to switch to door No. 2 without revealing any additional information or eliminating a losing option. This omission changes the dynamics of the problem. Without additional information provided by revealing a losing option, the probabilities remain the same as at the start: 1\/3 for each door. Thus, switching to door No. 2 doesn't inherently increase your chances of winning compared to sticking with door No. 1 or even switching to door No. 3 (which wasn't explicitly offered but is implied as a possible action).\n\nTherefore, without the host revealing a losing door, there is no statistical advantage to switching doors based on the information given in the problem statement.

This is because one of the chambers (the one just fired) is now known to be empty, and without spinning, it cannot be the next chamber to fire. Therefore, there are now 5 bullets left but only 5 chambers that could potentially have a bullet (since one chamber is now behind the firing pin and known to be empty).

The farmer can only take one of the wolf, goat, or cabbage across the river at a time, considering the boat has three separate secure compartments but likely only one can be accessed by the farmer at a time due to the constraints of the riddle. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. The farmer takes the goat across the river first. This move ensures that the goat is not left alone with the cabbage or the wolf. The wolf and the cabbage are safe together. (1 crossing)\n\n2. The farmer then returns alone to the original side to get either the wolf or the cabbage. Let's say he takes the wolf next. (2 crossings)\n\n3. The farmer leaves the wolf on the other side but takes the goat back with him to the original side. This is to ensure that the wolf doesn't eat the goat while he goes back to get the cabbage. (3 crossings)\n\n4. The farmer then takes the cabbage across the river, leaving it with the wolf. The wolf doesn't eat cabbage, so it's safe to leave them together. (4 crossings)\n\n5. Finally, the farmer returns alone to the original side one last time to bring the goat across. (5 crossings)\n\nThis sequence ensures that the goat is never left alone with the wolf without the farmer's supervision, and the goat is never left alone with the cabbage either.

After the fourth left turn and 1 km walk, we need to determine his final position and elevation.\n\nGiven the pattern of left turns and straight walks, the man essentially makes a square path. After four left turns, he would end up facing the same direction he started, implying he returns to his starting point in terms of horizontal and vertical position on a 2D plane.\n\nHowever, the problem lies in determining his final elevation. The elevation changes provided only account for three segments of the walk.

First, A and B cross the bridge with the torch, taking 2 minutes (since we consider the slower person's speed). Now, A is across, and B has the torch on the other side.\n2. A returns with the torch, taking 1 minute. So, 3 minutes have passed in total, and A is back on the starting side.\n3. C and D, the slowest members, cross together with the torch. This takes 10 minutes. Now, B, C, and D are across, and A is on the original side. 13 minutes have passed in total.\n4. B returns with the torch, taking 2 minutes.

Since the speed walking to the friend's house is 3 mph, the time taken to walk to the friend's house is \\(D\/3\\) hours.\n\nLet's denote the speed running back as \\(S\\) mph, and thus the time taken to run back is \\(D\/S\\) hours. The average speed for the entire trip is calculated as the total distance divided by the total time. The total distance for the trip is \\(2D\\) miles (to the friend's house and back), and the total time is \\(D\/3 + D\/S\\) hours.\n\nThe question states that we want to double the average speed for the entire trip compared to walking. Walking to the friend's house had an average speed of 3 mph, so we want the average speed for the entire trip to be 6 mph.\n\nThe formula for average speed is:\n\\[ \\text{Average speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total distance}}{\\text{Total time}} \\]\n\nSo, we want:\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{2D}{D\/3 + D\/S} \\]\n\nSolving for \\(S\\), we get:\n\\[ 6 = \\frac{2D}{D\/3 + D\/S} \\]\n\\[ 6(D\/3 + D\/S) = 2D \\]\n\\[ 2D + 6D\/S = 2D \\]\n\\[ 6D\/S = 0 \\]\n\nThis equation simplifies to an impossibility for any finite value of \\(S\\), because for the equation to hold true without resulting in an undefined or infinite scenario, the speed \\(S\\) would have to make the term \\(6D\/S\\) equal to \\(0\\), which cannot happen unless \\(S\\) is infinitely large because \\(D\\) is a positive distance and cannot be zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":100,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0}}
