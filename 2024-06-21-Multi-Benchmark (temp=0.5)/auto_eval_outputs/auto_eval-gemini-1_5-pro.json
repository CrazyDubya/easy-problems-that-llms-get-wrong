This action doesn't change the initial odds that your first choice was wrong (which was 2\/3).\n\n3. **The Switch:**  The key is that the host's action concentrates the remaining probability (that 2\/3 chance of being wrong) onto the single door you didn't initially choose.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"Here's the breakdown:\n\n**The Challenge:**\n\nThe Bible, particularly the King James Version, has a profound influence on the English language.  Many common words like \"love,\" \"peace,\" \"king,\" \"water,\" and even seemingly simple ones like \"the,\" \"and,\" \"it\" appear in the Bible.  This makes finding a sentence with entirely non-biblical words surprisingly tricky.\n\n**Analyzing the Options:**\n\n* **A. Cryptographic algorithms safeguard nuclear warheads.**  Words like \"safeguard\" and \"nuclear\" are likely not in the Bible due to their modern context. However, \"algorithms\" and \"warheads\" are derived from concepts (mathematics and weapons) that existed in biblical times, making their root words' presence in the Bible possible.\n\n* **B. Our computer, engineered in a contemporary lab, processes data flawlessly and efficiently.**  This option is full of modern technical terms. \"Computer,\" \"engineered,\" \"contemporary,\" \"lab,\" \"processes,\" \"data,\" \"flawlessly,\" and \"efficiently\" are all highly likely to be absent from the Bible.\n\n* **C. The computer swiftly executed complex algorithms.** This option shares similar reasoning with option B, featuring modern and technical terms like \"computer,\" \"executed,\" and \"algorithms.\"\n\n* **D. Quixotic zephyrs vexed the jabberwocky's kumquat garden.** This sentence is intentionally crafted with unusual and whimsical words. While \"garden\" appears in the Bible, the other words like \"quixotic,\" \"zephyrs,\" \"vexed,\" \"jabberwocky,\" and \"kumquat\" are highly improbable to be found within its pages.\n\n**The Best Choice:**\n\nOptions B, C, and D all have strong arguments. However, option **D. Quixotic zephyrs vexed the jabberwocky's kumquat garden.** is the most likely to satisfy the requirement. It uses highly specific and often literary words with origins far removed from the time period and subject matter of the Bible.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n``` \n","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'D'}","json_answer_letter":"D","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"218":{"level_0":218,"index":9,"category":"Popular science","question":"Which weighs more, a pound of water, two pounds of bricks, a pound of feathers, or three pounds of air.","human_answer":"Three pounds of air.","correct_answer":"Three pounds of air.","multiple_choice":["They all weigh the same.","A pound of feathers.","Three pounds of air.","Two pounds of brick."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Which weighs more, a pound of water, two pounds of bricks, a pound of feathers, or three pounds of air.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
