Binary searching is the most efficient way to find the poisoned bottle, as it halves the number of possibilities with each iteration. This problem can be solved by representing the bottles using binary numbers. \n\nThe king should organize the bottles in sets of two, assigning each pair a binary number based on the labels. For example, bottle 1 could be 00, bottle 2 could be 01, and so on, until all bottles are assigned a unique binary number. The prisoners then consume the wine in pairs, corresponding to the binary numbers. \n\nAfter 24 hours, the king checks on the prisoners and identifies the poisoned wine by correlating the binary number of the wine to the number of the prisoner who fell ill. This method significantly reduces the number of tests required and ensures the king can find the poisoned bottle within 24 hours, making it the best approach.","score":0,"json_answer":"{'ANSWER': 'B'}","json_answer_letter":"B","invalid_answer_letter":0.0},"77":{"level_0":77,"index":18,"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

One person crossing the bridge takes 1 minute, so the total time required for everyone to cross is the sum of their individual times: 1 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 18 minutes. However, since they are sharing a single torch, the torch needs to be passed from one person to the next. This means the time for the torch to be passed between each person needs to be accounted for. We can assume that each 'handover' of the torch takes 1 minute. Therefore, the total time with these handovers included is 1 + 3 + 6 + 10 + 1 = 21 minutes. But, since the torch is with the slowest person, D, for 10 minutes, this time can be saved, making the fastest time 21 - 10 = 11 minutes. As two people need to stand on the bridge together for each handover, the next most logical place to save time is the handover between A and B.
