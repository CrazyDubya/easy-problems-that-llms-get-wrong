The binary search strategy works by dividing the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.

The time taken to walk to the friend's house at 3mph is T1 = D\/3 hours.\n\nLet's say the speed required to run back is R mph. The time taken to run back is T2 = D\/R hours.\n\nThe average speed for the entire trip is the total distance divided by the total time. Since the total distance is 2D (going and coming back), the average speed is:\n\nAverage Speed = Total Distance \/ Total Time\nAverage Speed = 2D \/ (T1 + T2)\n\nWe want the average speed to be double the walking speed, which is 6mph. So we set the average speed equal to 6 and solve for R:\n\n6 = 2D \/ (D\/3 + D\/R)\n\nTo solve for R, we first simplify the equation:\n\n6 = 2 \/ (1\/3 + 1\/R)\n6 * (1\/3 + 1\/R) = 2\n2 + 6\/R = 2\n6\/R = 0\n\nThis equation has no solution, which means it's impossible to double the average speed for the entire trip by running back at any finite speed. The correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n\nHowever, if we want to find the speed required to run back such that the average speed for the entire trip is 6mph, we can set up the equation as follows:\n\n6 = 2D \/ (D\/3 + D\/R)\n\nSolving for R, we get:\n\n6 = 2 \/ (1\/3 + 1\/R)\n6 * (1\/3 + 1\/R) = 2\n2 + 6\/R = 2\n6\/R = 0\n\nThis is not possible, as we cannot have R = 0. We need to correct the equation by considering the total distance as 2D and solve for R:\n\n6 = 2D \/ (D\/3 + D\/R)\n6 = 2 \/ (1\/3 + 1\/R)\n6 * (1\/3 + 1\/R) = 2\n2\/3 + 2\/R = 2\n2\/R = 4\/3\nR = 3\/2\n\nSo, the correct answer is that we need to run back at 1.5 times the walking speed, which is 4.5mph, not double the walking speed.
