This is crucial because the host knows what's behind the doors and is deliberately offering you a choice.\n\n4. The host's question doesn't change the probability of your initial choice (Door No. 1) being correct. It's still 1\/3.\n\n5. However, by asking about Door No. 2, the host is implicitly telling you that Door No. 3 is not the winning door. This is because if the gold bar were behind Door No. 3, the host would have asked about Door No. 3 instead.\n\n6. This means that the 2\/3 probability that was initially spread across Doors No. 2 and No. 3 is now concentrated on Door No. 2.\n\nTherefore, switching to Door No. 2 gives you a 2\/3 chance of winning, while staying with Door No. 1 keeps your chances at 1\/3.

We need to formulate a question that will give us the correct information regardless of which guard we ask.\n\nThe key is to ask a question that forces both guards to give the same answer, regardless of whether they're lying or telling the truth. Here's such a question:\n\n\"If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\nLet's break down why this works:\n\n- If you ask the truthful guard, they will truthfully tell you what the lying guard would say, which would be the wrong door (death).\n- If you ask the lying guard, they will lie about what the truthful guard would say, which would also result in the wrong door (death).\n\nSo, regardless of which guard you ask, the answer will always point to the death door.

Let's say the distance to your friend's house is x miles.\n\n2. At 3 mph, the time taken to walk there is x\/3 hours.\n\n3. Let's say the speed to run back is y mph. The time taken to run back would be x\/y hours.\n\n4. The total distance covered is 2x miles (x there and x back).\n\n5. The total time taken is (x\/3 + x\/y) hours.\n\n6. We want the average speed for the entire trip to be 6 mph (double the walking speed).\n\n7. Average speed = Total distance \/ Total time\n   6 = 2x \/ (x\/3 + x\/y)\n\n8. Solving this equation:\n   6(x\/3 + x\/y) = 2x\n   2x\/3 + 2x\/y = 2x\n   2x\/y = 2x - 2x\/3 = 4x\/3\n   y = 2x \/ (4x\/3) = 3\/2 * 4 = 6\n\nTherefore, you would need to run back at 6 mph to make the average speed for the entire trip 6 mph (double your walking speed).\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""}}
