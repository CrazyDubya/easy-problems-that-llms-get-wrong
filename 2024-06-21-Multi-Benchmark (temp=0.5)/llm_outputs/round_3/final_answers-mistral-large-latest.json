The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is not by taste (since the poison is not immediately identifiable by bitterness) or by dividing the bottles evenly among the prisoners (since this would likely result in too many prisoners dying and not enough information gathered). Instead, the king can use a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works: The king can label each bottle with a unique binary number that is 10 digits long (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than enough to label 1000 bottles). Each digit in the binary number corresponds to a different prisoner. If the digit is 1, the prisoner drinks from that bottle; if the digit is 0, the prisoner does not drink from that bottle.\n\nAfter 24 hours, the king can look at which prisoners have died and which have survived. The binary numbers corresponding to the bottles that the dead prisoners drank from will have a 1 in the position corresponding to that prisoner, and the binary numbers corresponding to the bottles that the surviving prisoners drank from will have a 0 in the position corresponding to that prisoner. By looking at the pattern of 1s and 0s, the king can determine the unique binary number (and therefore the unique bottle) that caused the deaths.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
