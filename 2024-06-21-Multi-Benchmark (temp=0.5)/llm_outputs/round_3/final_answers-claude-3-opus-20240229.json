Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"Here is my analysis:\n\nThe key to solving this efficiently is to use the 10 prisoners in a way that minimizes the number of tests needed to identify the single poisoned bottle out of 1000. A binary search strategy is ideal for this.\n\nWe can number the bottles 1 to 1000 and represent each number in binary (which will take 10 bits, e.g. 0000000001 to 1111101000). Then assign each prisoner a \"bit position\". For each bottle, a prisoner samples the wine if and only if their assigned bit is 1 in that bottle's number.\n\nAfter 24 hours, the king can look at which prisoners have died. The bit positions of the dead prisoners will correspond to the binary representation of the poisoned bottle's number.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 4, 5, and 10 died, then the 1st, 4th, 5th and 10th bits are 1s. So the poisoned bottle number in binary is 1000011001, or bottle #537.\n\nThis leverages the prisoners as \"bits\" to efficiently search the sample space in one 24 hour period, which is the fastest possible way.\n\nSo in summary:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
