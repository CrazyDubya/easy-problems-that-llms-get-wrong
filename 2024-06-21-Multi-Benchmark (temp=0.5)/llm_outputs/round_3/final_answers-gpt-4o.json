Ask either guardian the following question: \"If I were to ask the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would they point to?\"\n\n- If you ask the truth-telling guardian, they will truthfully tell you that the lying guardian would point to the death door.\n- If you ask the lying guardian, they will lie about the truth-telling guardian's response and also point to the death door.\n\nIn both cases, the door they point to will be the death door.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"To determine how fast you would have to run back to double the average speed for the entire trip, let's break down the problem.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( d \\) be the distance to your friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_1 \\) be the time taken to walk to your friend's house.\n   - Let \\( t_2 \\) be the time taken to run back.\n\n2. **Calculate \\( t_1 \\):**\n   - Since you walk to your friend's house at 3 mph, the time taken to walk there is \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\).\n\n3. **Average Speed:**\n   - The total distance for the round trip is \\( 2d \\).\n   - The total time for the round trip is \\( t_1 + t_2 \\).\n\n4. **Desired Average Speed:**\n   - You want the average speed for the entire trip to be double your walking speed, which is \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) mph.\n\n5. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   - The formula for average speed is \\( \\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}} \\).\n   - Plugging in the values: \\( 6 = \\frac{2d}{t_1 + t_2} \\).\n\n6. **Substitute \\( t_1 \\):**\n   - We know \\( t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\), so \\( 6 = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{3} + t_2} \\).\n\n7. **Solve for \\( t_2 \\):**\n   - Simplify the equation: \\( 6 = \\frac{2d}{\\frac{d}{3} + t_2} \\).\n   - Multiply both sides by \\( \\frac{d}{3} + t_2 \\): \\( 6 \\left( \\frac{d}{3} + t_2 \\right) = 2d \\).\n   - Distribute 6: \\( 2d + 6t_2 = 2d \\).\n   - Subtract \\( 2d \\) from both sides: \\( 6t_2 = 0 \\).\n   - Divide by 6: \\( t_2 = 0 \\).\n\nThis means that to achieve an average speed of 6 mph for the entire trip, you would need to spend no time running back, which is impossible. Therefore, you would have to run back infinitely fast.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"A\"\n}\n```","score":""}}
