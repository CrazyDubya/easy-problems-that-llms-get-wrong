What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the correct answer is **B** and an explanation of the strategy:\n\n* **The Goal:** Identify the single poisoned bottle out of 1000 within 24 hours.\n\n* **Why A, C, and D are incorrect:**\n    * **A:**  This would kill all the prisoners and is incredibly inhumane!\n    * **C:** This doesn't provide enough information. You'll only know which group of bottles contained the poison, not the specific bottle.\n    * **D:** The poison is explicitly stated to take effect after 24 hours, so tasting it won't reveal the poisoned bottle immediately.\n\n* **Why B is correct (Binary Search):**\n\n    1. **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n    2. **Number the Bottles:**  Imagine each bottle is numbered from 1 to 1000. Convert these numbers to their binary representation (e.g., Bottle 1 is 0000000001, Bottle 2 is 0000000010, Bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.)\n    3. **Assign Wine Based on Binary:** Each prisoner will drink from bottles based on their corresponding binary digit. \n        * For example:\n            * Prisoner 1 drinks from every bottle where the *last* binary digit is a 1.\n            * Prisoner 2 drinks from every bottle where the *second to last* binary digit is a 1.\n            * ...and so on.\n    4. **Observe After 24 Hours:**  Note which prisoners die.  If a prisoner dies, their corresponding binary digit is a '1'. If they live, it's a '0'. \n    5. **Construct the Binary Number:** Create a binary number based on the dead\/alive prisoners. For example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 0010100001.\n    6. **Convert to Decimal:** Convert the resulting binary number back to decimal form. This decimal number is the poisoned bottle!\n\n* **Why Binary Search Works:** Binary search is incredibly efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles in a single round. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
