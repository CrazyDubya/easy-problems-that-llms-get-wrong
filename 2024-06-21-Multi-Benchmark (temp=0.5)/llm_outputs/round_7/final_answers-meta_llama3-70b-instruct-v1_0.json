If we race all six horses together in one race, we can immediately determine the fastest horse.\n2. However, if we want to minimize the number of races, we can't do just one race with all six horses, because then we wouldn't know the relative speeds of the horses that didn't come in first.\n\nBut wait, actually, we can!

Option A is not feasible because the poison takes effect in 24 hours, so the prisoners won't be able to taste the bitterness immediately. Option C is also not efficient, as it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is impractical and unnecessary.\n\nOption B is a good start, but it's not the most efficient approach. By dividing the bottles among the prisoners, each prisoner would have to test around 100 bottles, and the king would still need to wait 24 hours to see which prisoner dies. This approach would require multiple rounds of testing to narrow down the poisoned bottle.\n\nThe most efficient approach is Option D, which uses a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a binary number from 0 to 999 (using 10 digits, 2^10 = 1024, which is greater than 1000).\n2. Assign each prisoner a specific binary digit (0 or 1) for each of the 10 digits.\n3. Each prisoner drinks a mixture of wine from the bottles that correspond to their assigned binary digit. For example, Prisoner 1 drinks a mixture of wine from bottles with a 0 in the first digit, Prisoner 2 drinks a mixture of wine from bottles with a 1 in the first digit, and so on.\n4. Wait 24 hours and observe which prisoners die.\n5.
