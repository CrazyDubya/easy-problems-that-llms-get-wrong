Initially, you have a 1\/3 chance of picking the door with the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance of picking a door with rotten vegetables.\n2. When you pick door No. 1, there is a 1\/3 chance that door No. 1 has the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance that one of the other two doors (No. 2 or No. 3) has the gold bar.\n3. The host knows what is behind each door and will always offer you a chance to switch by revealing a door with rotten vegetables. This does not change the initial probabilities.\n4. If you stick with your initial choice (door No. 1), your probability of winning remains 1\/3.\n5. If you switch to the other door (in this case, door No. 2), your probability of winning increases to 2\/3 because the host's action of revealing a door with rotten vegetables effectively transfers the probability of winning to the remaining unopened door.\n\nThus, the best strategy is to switch doors, giving you a higher probability of winning the gold bar.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Since no bullet comes out, he must have landed on the single empty chamber.\n\n3. **Your Turn**: Now you have the choice to either spin the chambers again or not.\n\n- **If you do not spin again**: The revolver is currently on the empty chamber. There are 5 remaining chambers, all of which contain bullets. Therefore, if you do not spin, the probability of firing a bullet is 5 out of 5 (or 100%).\n\n- **If you spin again**: Spinning the chambers randomizes the position again.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"To solve the problem efficiently within the 24-hour constraint and using the 10 prisoners, we can leverage the concept of binary numbers. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each of the 1000 bottles can be uniquely identified using a binary number. Since 2^10 = 1024, we can represent each bottle with a unique 10-bit binary number (since 1024 is greater than 1000).\n\n2. **Assigning Bottles to Prisoners**: Assign each bottle a unique binary number from 0000000001 to 1111101000 (1 to 1000 in decimal). Each bit in the binary number corresponds to one of the 10 prisoners. For instance, if the binary representation of a bottle is 1010101010, then prisoners 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 will drink from this bottle.\n\n3. **Testing**: Each prisoner will drink from all bottles where their corresponding bit in the binary representation is 1. For example, prisoner 1 will drink from bottles whose binary representation has a 1 in the first position, prisoner 2 will drink from bottles whose binary representation has a 1 in the second position, and so on.\n\n4. **Identifying the Poisoned Bottle**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who died will correspond to the binary number of the poisoned bottle. For example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 5 die, and the others do not, the binary number would be 1010000000, which can be converted back to a decimal number to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours using the minimum number of tests.\n\nGiven this explanation, the correct choice is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The time taken to walk to your friend's house at 3 mph is:\n\\[ t_{\\text{walk}} = \\frac{d}{3} \\]\n\nTo double the average speed for the entire trip, the average speed must be:\n\\[ 2 \\times 3 \\text{ mph} = 6 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nThe total distance for the round trip is:\n\\[ 2d \\]\n\nThe total time for the round trip at an average speed of 6 mph would be:\n\\[ t_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{2d}{6} = \\frac{d}{3} \\]\n\nThis means the total time for the trip must be the same as the time taken to walk to your friend's house:\n\\[ t_{\\text{walk}} + t_{\\text{run}} = \\frac{d}{3} \\]\n\nSince \\( t_{\\text{walk}} \\) is already \\( \\frac{d}{3} \\), there is no time left for the return trip:\n\\[ \\frac{d}{3} + t_{\\text{run}} = \\frac{d}{3} \\]\n\\[ t_{\\text{run}} = 0 \\]\n\nFor \\( t_{\\text{run}} \\) to be zero, the running speed must be infinitely fast.
