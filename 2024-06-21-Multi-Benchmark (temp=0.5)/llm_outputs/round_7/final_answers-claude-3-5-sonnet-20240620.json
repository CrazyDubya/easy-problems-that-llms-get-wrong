The host, who knows what's behind the doors, is offering you to switch to Door No. 2. This is crucial information.\n\n4. If the gold bar was behind Door No. 3, the host wouldn't offer Door No. 2.

But we've already spent x\/3 hours walking there. So we have no time left for the return trip!\n\n6. No matter how fast we run back, we can't make the average speed for the entire trip exactly double the walking speed.\n\n7. We would need to run back instantaneously (infinitely fast) to achieve this.\n\nTherefore, it's mathematically impossible to achieve exactly double the average speed for the entire trip by running back at any finite speed.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""}}
