Assuming no leap years for simplicity, we'll divide 365 by 2, which means that at around 183 people, you'd have a 50% chance of finding a pair with the same birthday. \n\nNow, for twins, you essentially have twice the number of people, each with two birthdays, which gives four possible combinations per pair.
