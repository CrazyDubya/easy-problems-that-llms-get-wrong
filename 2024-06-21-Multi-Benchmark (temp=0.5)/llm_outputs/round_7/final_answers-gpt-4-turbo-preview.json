Since the speed walking to the friend's house is 3mph, the time taken for this trip, \\(t_1\\), can be calculated as \\(d \/ 3\\) hours.\n\nLet \\(v\\) be the speed (in mph) at which one has to run back to double the average speed for the entire trip. The time taken for the return trip, \\(t_2\\), is \\(d \/ v\\) hours.\n\nThe total distance of the round trip is \\(2d\\) miles, and the total time is \\(t_1 + t_2 = d\/3 + d\/v\\) hours. The average speed for the entire trip, \\(S_{avg}\\), is the total distance divided by the total time, which gives:\n\\[S_{avg} = \\frac{2d}{d\/3 + d\/v} = \\frac{2d}{(d(3+v))\/(3v)} = \\frac{6v}{3+v}\\]\n\nWe want this average speed to be twice the walking speed, i.e., \\(2 \\times 3\\) mph = 6 mph. Substituting \\(S_{avg}\\) with 6 mph gives us:\n\\[6 = \\frac{6v}{3+v}\\]\n\nSolving for \\(v\\) gives:\n\\[6(3+v) = 6v\\]\n\\[18 + 6v = 6v\\]\n\nThis equation simplifies to \\(18 = 0\\), which is a contradiction, indicating a mistake in the manipulation. The correct step to find \\(v\\) after setting up the equation \\(\\frac{6v}{3+v} = 6\\) should be:\n\n\\[6 = \\frac{6v}{3+v}\\]\nMultiplying both sides by \\(3+v\\) to clear the denominator:\n\\[6(3+v) = 6v\\]\n\\[18 + 6v = 6v\\]\n\nTo correctly solve for \\(v\\), we should have set up the equation to solve for doubling the average speed correctly. Let's correct the approach:\n\nWe want the average speed over the entire trip to be twice the speed of the first leg, which means the average speed should be \\(2 \\times 3\\) mph = 6 mph. However, we've misinterpreted how to apply this to find \\(v\\). The correct approach is to understand that if the average speed of the entire trip is to be doubled from the initial speed of 3 mph, it should be 6 mph, but we need to correctly calculate the speed \\(v\\) to achieve this.\n\nFor the entire trip (both ways) to average 6 mph, the time taken for both legs of the trip must fit the definition of averaging 6 mph over the total distance. However, we realize we've made a mistake in our setup and solution path. Let's correct the logic:\n\nTo double the average speed for the entire trip to \\(2 \\times 3\\) mph = 6 mph, we need to consider how the average speed is calculated over the total distance and total time. The mistake was in the algebraic manipulation and the interpretation of how to achieve the doubled average speed. \n\nGiven the confusion and errors in solving, let's directly address the question with the correct reasoning, bypassing the incorrect algebraic manipulation:\n\nTo actually double the average speed for the entire trip to 6 mph considering the walking speed is 3 mph for one way, we look at the premise that the average speed is the total distance divided by the total time. If the speed to the friend's house is 3 mph, and we want the average speed for the round trip to be 6 mph, we essentially want the round trip to take the same amount of time it would take at a constant speed of 6 mph. However, the premise of doubling the average speed to 6 mph by running back at a specific speed is flawed without correctly calculating the necessary speed. \n\nGiven the confusion in the explanation and realizing the mistake in the algebraic approach, let's clarify with the correct insight:\n\nDoubling the overall average speed is not straightforwardly achieved by doubling the speed on the return trip alone due to the non-linear relationship between speed, distance, and time. The correct answer involves a more nuanced calculation, which was not correctly outlined.\n\nThe correct approach is to realize that to average a certain speed over a given distance, the time taken is crucial. If you walk at 3 mph to some place and want to average 6 mph for the entire trip, you would have to make the return trip instantaneously or \"infinitely fast\" because any time spent on the return trip would lower the average speed below the target of 6 mph for the entire distance.\n\nGiven this realization, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```\nThis answer reflects the understanding that to double the average speed of the entire trip to 6 mph, considering half of the trip was made at 3 mph, the return trip would theoretically have to take no time, implying an infinite speed.","score":""}}
