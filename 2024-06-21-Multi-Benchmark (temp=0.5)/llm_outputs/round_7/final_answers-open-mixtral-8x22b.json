Initially, the probability of the gold bar being behind each door is equal (1\/3). However, when the host offers to open door No. 2, they are essentially giving you information. If you initially picked a door with rotten vegetables (which has a 2\/3 probability), the host will always offer to open the other door with rotten vegetables. So, if the host offers to open door No. 2, there is a 2\/3 chance that the gold bar is behind door No. 3. Therefore, switching to door No. 3 gives you the biggest advantage. However, since the question asks for the choice of door now, and the host is offering to open door No. 2, the only remaining choice is door No. 1, which is not the best option.

This method minimizes the number of tests needed and ensures that the king will know the results in 24 hours. Here's how it works: Label each bottle of wine with a unique binary number from 0000000000 to 1111111111. Each prisoner will sample a single drop of wine from the bottles corresponding to the '1' in their assigned binary position. For example, prisoner 1 will sample the bottles corresponding to the rightmost binary digit, prisoner 2 will sample the bottles corresponding to the second rightmost binary digit, and so on. After 24 hours, the king will know which binary digit corresponds to the poisoned bottle by observing which prisoner(s) have been affected. This process can be repeated with a smaller subset of bottles to further narrow down the possibilities until the poisoned bottle is identified.\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

This is a variation of the birthday paradox, which states that in a group of just 23 people, there is a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday. However, the question asks for pairs of twins, which means we are looking for the probability that two people from different pairs of twins share a birthday.\n\nSince each pair of twins has the same birthday, we need to consider the birthdays of the twin pairs, rather than the individual people. There are 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years), so the probability of two twin pairs having the same birthday is 1\/365. To find the number of twin pairs needed to have at least a 50% chance of a shared birthday, we can use the formula for the probability of at least one event occurring:\n\nP(at least one shared birthday) = 1 - P(no shared birthdays)\n\nLet x be the number of twin pairs. Then the probability of no shared birthdays is:\n\nP(no shared birthdays) = (364\/365)^(x choose 2)\n\nwhere (x choose 2) is the number of ways to choose 2 twin pairs out of x, which is equal to x(x-1)\/2.\n\nWe want to find the smallest x such that:\n\n1 - (364\/365)^(x(x-1)\/2) >= 0.5\n\nSolving this inequality, we find that x >= 46.
