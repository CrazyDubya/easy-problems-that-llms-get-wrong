There's still a 1\/3 chance the gold bar is behind Door No. 1, a 1\/3 chance it's behind Door No. 2, and a 1\/3 chance it's behind Door No. 3.\n3.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"The fastest way to identify the poisoned bottle is not by dividing the bottles among the prisoners and waiting for someone to die, as that would take more than 24 hours to get a result. Instead, the king can use a binary search strategy, which is a method of finding an item in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. In this case, the king can assign each prisoner a unique binary number from 0 to 1010 (1023 in decimal) and have them drink the wine from the bottles corresponding to the '1's in their binary number. For example, if a prisoner's binary number is 0101, they would drink from bottles 1 and 3. After 24 hours, the king can look at the prisoners who have died and use their binary numbers to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners with binary numbers 0001, 0101, and 1001 have died, the king would know that the poisoned bottle is either 1, 3, or 7 (since those are the bottles that all three prisoners drank from). The king can then look at the binary numbers of the dead prisoners to see which bottle corresponds to the '1' that is present in all of their binary numbers. In this case, the '1' that is present in all three binary numbers is the third digit from the right, so the poisoned bottle is bottle number 4 (since binary 100 is equal to decimal 4).\n\nThis method allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one day, as he only needs to wait 24 hours to see which prisoners have died.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

If we are considering twins, then each pair of twins would already share the same birthday. Therefore, you would only need one pair of twins to have a 100% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n\nHowever, if we ignore the twin aspect and treat this as a standard birthday problem, then we would use the formula for the probability that at least two people share a birthday, which is 1 - P(none share a birthday).\n\nIn a non-leap year, there are 365 days, so the probability that the first person has a unique birthday is 365\/365, the second person 364\/365, the third person 363\/365, and so on. We want the probability that at least two people share a birthday to be 50% or more, so we want the probability that none share a birthday to be less than 50%.\n\nWhen we calculate this for 23 people, we get (365\/365) * (364\/365) * ... * (343\/365) = 0.4927, which is less than 50%.\n\nSo, if we ignore the twin aspect, the answer would be 23 pairs of people (or 46 people in total).
