Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"C\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the answer is C and the reasoning behind it:\n\n* **A is incorrect** because it only allows for testing 10 bottles at a time.  If one of those bottles is poisoned, you won't be able to determine which of the 10 it was.\n* **B is incorrect** because it's logistically impossible. Each prisoner would need to take 1000 sips, and there's no way to ensure they could do that in a reasonable timeframe.\n* **D is incorrect** because the poison is explicitly stated to be tasteless (only taking effect after 24 hours).\n\n**C is the correct answer** because it utilizes the efficiency of binary search:\n\n1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.  Think of these numbers in binary (1 is 001, 2 is 010, 3 is 011,  4 is 100, and so on).  Each prisoner represents a 'place value' in binary (units, twos, fours, eights, etc.).\n2. **Labeling Bottles:**  Mentally number the wine bottles from 1 to 1000.\n3. **Giving Wine:** Each prisoner drinks from bottles where their corresponding binary 'place value' is a '1'. For example:\n    * Prisoner 1 (001 in binary) drinks from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7... (all odd-numbered bottles).\n    * Prisoner 2 (010 in binary) drinks from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11... \n    * Prisoner 4 (100 in binary) drinks from bottles 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15...\n4. **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died.  Construct a binary number where '1' represents a dead prisoner and '0' a living one. This binary number directly corresponds to the poisoned bottle.\n\n**Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 011001, which converts to decimal 25, indicating bottle number 25 was poisoned.\n\n**Why Binary Search Works:**  Binary search is incredibly efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles in a single iteration. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The Birthday Paradox explores the surprisingly high probability of shared birthdays in relatively small groups. Here's how to approach this variation:\\n\\n* **Focus on Unique Birthdays:** Instead of calculating the probability of a shared birthday, it's easier to calculate the probability that *everyone* has a *different* birthday. Then, subtract that probability from 1 to get the probability of at least one shared birthday.\\n* **Twins Share Birthdays:** Since each pair of twins shares a birthday, we effectively reduce the number of 'unique birthday slots' available.\\n* **Calculation:**  With 23 pairs of twins (46 people), the first person has 365 potential birthdays (ignoring leap years). The second person has only 364 potential 'unique' birthdays left, the third has 363, and so on. \\n    * This pattern continues, and when we reach the 46th person, there's a high probability they'll share a birthday with someone already in the room.\\n* **Approximation:**  While the exact calculation is complex, the birthday paradox tells us that with around 23 people, the probability of a shared birthday is already above 50%. Since we're dealing with twins, 23 pairs is a reasonable approximation for when the probability surpasses 50%.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
