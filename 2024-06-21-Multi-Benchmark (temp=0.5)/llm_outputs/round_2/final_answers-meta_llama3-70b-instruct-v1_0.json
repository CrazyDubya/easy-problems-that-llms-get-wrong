The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption, which means that the king can only perform one round of testing.\n\nOption A is not efficient, as it would require each prisoner to test 100 bottles of wine, which would be impractical and may not even be possible in 24 hours.\n\nOption B is not feasible, as it would require each prisoner to test all 1000 bottles of wine, which is clearly impossible in 24 hours.\n\nOption D is not possible, as the poison is bitter but takes effect only after 24 hours, so the prisoners cannot rely on their sense of taste to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nOption C is the correct answer. The king can use a binary search strategy to identify the poisoned bottle. Here's one way to do it:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles of wine into two groups of 500 each.\n2. Assign 5 prisoners to test the first group and 5 prisoners to test the second group.\n3. If all 5 prisoners in one group die, then the poisoned bottle is in that group. If not, then the poisoned bottle is in the other group.\n4. Repeat the process, dividing the remaining group of 500 bottles into two groups of 250 each, and assigning 5 prisoners to test each group.\n5. Continue this process until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nUsing this strategy, the king can identify the poisoned bottle in just 24 hours, with a maximum of 10 tests.

We want to find the minimum number of pairs of twins (i.e., people) needed in a room so that there's at least a 50% chance that two people share the same birthday.\n2. Since we're dealing with pairs of twins, we can assume that each pair has the same birthday.\n3. We can model this problem using the concept of independent events. Specifically, we want to find the number of people (not pairs) needed so that the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday is greater than or equal to 50%.\n4. Let's assume there are n people in the room. The probability that a single person has a unique birthday (i.e., no one else shares their birthday) is 365\/365, since there are 365 possible birthdays (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n5. The probability that the second person has a unique birthday (different from the first person) is 364\/365, since one birthday is already taken.\n6. The probability that the third person has a unique birthday (different from the first two) is 363\/365, and so on.\n7. We can calculate the probability that all n people have unique birthdays by multiplying these probabilities together: (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365).\n8. We want to find the smallest n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is greater than or equal to 50%. This means we need to find the smallest n such that the probability of all n people having unique birthdays is less than or equal to 50%.\n9. Using a calculator or computer, we can find that this occurs when n = 23.\n\nNow, let's convert this to pairs of twins. Since each pair has the same birthday, we can consider each pair as a single unit. Therefore, we need 23 \"units\" (pairs of twins) in the room for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
