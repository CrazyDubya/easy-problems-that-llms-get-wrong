If we ask the truthful guard:\n   They will truthfully tell us what the lying guard would say.

Let's say the distance to your friend's house is x miles.\n\n2. At 3 mph, the time taken to walk there is x\/3 hours.\n\n3. Let's say the speed to run back is y mph. The time taken to run back would be x\/y hours.\n\n4. The total time for the round trip is (x\/3 + x\/y) hours.\n\n5. The total distance covered is 2x miles.\n\n6. For the average speed of the entire trip to be double the walking speed (i.e., 6 mph), we need:\n\n   2x \/ (x\/3 + x\/y) = 6\n\n7. Simplifying this equation:\n   12\/3 + 12\/y = 2\n   4 + 12\/y = 2\n   12\/y = -2\n   y = -6\n\n8. However, speed can't be negative. This means there's no finite speed at which you can run back to make the average speed of the entire trip exactly double your walking speed.\n\n9. You would need to run back infinitely fast to approach (but never quite reach) doubling your average speed for the entire trip.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Infinitely fast.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""}}
