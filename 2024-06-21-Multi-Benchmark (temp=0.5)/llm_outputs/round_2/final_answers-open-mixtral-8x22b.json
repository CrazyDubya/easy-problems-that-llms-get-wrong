Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nC.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe best way to identify the poisoned bottle is to use a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners. This method minimizes the number of tests needed and allows the king to find the poisoned bottle in the shortest time possible.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Number the bottles from 1 to 1000.\n2. Divide the bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each. Assign each group to a prisoner.\n3. Each prisoner drinks from one bottle in their group.\n4. After 24 hours, the king checks which prisoners have died.\n5. The group that contains the poisoned bottle can be identified by the prisoner who died.\n6. The remaining prisoners are assigned to the bottles in that group.\n7. Steps 3 to 6 are repeated until the poisoned bottle is identified.\n\nThis method allows the king to find the poisoned bottle with a maximum of 10 tests, as each test eliminates a group of 100 bottles. This is much faster than the other options, which involve either testing many bottles or waiting for the poison to take effect.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

When you walk to your friend's house, you travel at 3mph, so the time taken to walk there is D\/3 hours.\n\nWhen you return, you want your average speed for the entire trip to be double the walking speed. Since the average speed for the entire trip is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, we can set up the following equation:\n\nAverage speed = (Total distance) \/ (Total time)\n\nThe total distance for the round trip is 2D, and the total time is the sum of the time taken to walk there and the time taken to run back. We want the average speed to be 2 * 3mph = 6mph. So, we have:\n\n6mph = 2D \/ (D\/3 + D\/R)\n\nHere, R is the speed at which you run back. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n\n6 = 2 \/ (1\/3 + 1\/R)\n\nMultiplying both sides by (1\/3 + 1\/R), we get:\n\n6 * (1\/3 + 1\/R) = 2\n\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\n2 + 6\/R = 2\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides, we get:\n\n6\/R = 0\n\nHowever, this equation has no solution since R cannot be infinity.
