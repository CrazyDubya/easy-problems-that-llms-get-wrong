While your initial intuition might favor sticking with your first choice (Door No. 1), the optimal strategy actually involves switching to the remaining unopened door (Door No. 2 in this case).\n\nHere's why:\n\n* **Initially, each door has a 1\/3 probability of hiding the prize.** This is because you have no prior information about the prize's location.\n* **When the host reveals a goat behind one of the unchosen doors, the information changes.** This revelation eliminates one losing option, effectively doubling the probability of the prize being behind either of the remaining doors.\n* **Therefore, switching to the other unopened door (Door No. 2) increases your chances of winning to 2\/3.** This is because the remaining unopened door now encompasses the combined probability of the initial 1\/3 chance for Door No. 2 and the 1\/3 chance that was shifted from the revealed goat door.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n**{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}** \n\n**Explanation:** Switching to Door No. 2 gives you the biggest advantage, increasing your probability of winning the gold bar to 2\/3. \n","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

We need to determine the impact of this information on the probability of survival in the next shot.\n\n**Let's analyze the options:**\n\n**A. The probabilities are random and unknown:** This statement is incorrect. While the outcome of each individual spin is random, the overall probability of survival can be calculated based on the known information about the revolver's state.\n\n**B.

The revolver already has a specific arrangement of bullets and empty chambers, and spinning it again wouldn't change that arrangement. \n\n**C. It makes no difference if you spin again or not:** This option is the most accurate. Since the outcome of the first shot tells us that the empty chamber is not directly opposite the barrel, the probability of survival remains the same regardless of whether you spin the chamber again.\n\n**D.

Let's analyze the provided options:\n\n**A. Divide the bottles amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.**\n\nThis approach is inefficient and risky. If the poisoned bottle is among the first few consumed, the remaining prisoners wouldn't be able to help identify it. Additionally, sacrificing all prisoners is a drastic and unnecessary measure.\n\n**B. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.**\n\nThis option is even more wasteful and cruel. Each prisoner would need to drink 1000 sips, leading to potential overconsumption and unnecessary suffering. \n\n**C. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours.**\n\nThis is the most efficient and logical approach. By assigning each prisoner a unique binary code and having them taste specific combinations of wines based on their code, the king can narrow down the possibilities with each round of testing. This method requires significantly fewer sips compared to option B and guarantees identifying the poisoned bottle within 24 hours.\n\n**D. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.**\n\nThis option relies on the assumption that the poison has a distinct bitter taste. However, the prompt doesn't guarantee this. Additionally, relying solely on taste is unreliable, as individual taste perception can vary.\n\nTherefore, the optimal solution is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n```\n\n**Explanation:** \n\nThe binary search strategy minimizes the number of tests needed, maximizing efficiency and minimizing risk to the prisoners. It's a logical and effective approach to identify the poisoned bottle within the 24-hour timeframe. \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
