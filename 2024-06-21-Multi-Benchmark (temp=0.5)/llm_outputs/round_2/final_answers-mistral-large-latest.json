First, divide the horses into two groups of three and race them separately. This will give you the fastest horse from each group, but not overall yet.\n\n2. Next, race the two fastest horses from the first two races against each other. The winner of this race is the fastest horse overall.\n\n3.

The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nC. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy. This strategy is based on the concept of binary numbers, where each test can be seen as a digit in a binary number, and each prisoner can be seen as a \"bit\" in the number.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label the bottles from 0 to 999 in binary, which requires 10 digits (as 2^10 = 1024, which is more than the number of bottles).\n2. For each test, assign a bottle to a prisoner based on the binary representation of the bottle's label. If the digit corresponding to the prisoner's test is 1, the prisoner drinks from the bottle. If it's 0, the prisoner does not drink from the bottle.\n3. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners have died. The binary number represented by the digits corresponding to the dead prisoners will be the label of the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 4, and 8 die, the poisoned bottle would be labeled 0000100011 in binary, which is 35 in decimal.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to test all 1000 bottles with only 10 prisoners in 24 hours.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
