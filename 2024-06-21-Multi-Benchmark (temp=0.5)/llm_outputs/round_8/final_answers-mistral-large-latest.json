Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"The fastest way to identify the poisoned bottle is not by dividing the bottles among the prisoners and waiting for one of them to die or taste the bitterness, as this would not provide enough information to pinpoint the exact bottle within 24 hours. Instead, the king can use a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique 10-digit binary number (since there are 1024 possible combinations, and we only have 1000 bottles, this will work). For example, the first bottle would be 0000000001, and the last bottle would be 1111101000.\n2. Assign each prisoner to a digit in the binary number. For example, Prisoner 1 would be responsible for the first digit, Prisoner 2 for the second digit, and so on.\n3. If the digit assigned to a prisoner is 1, that prisoner will take a sip from the bottle. If the digit is 0, the prisoner will not take a sip.\n4. After 24 hours, if a prisoner is still alive, their assigned digit for all the bottles they drank from is 0. If a prisoner dies, their assigned digit for the poisoned bottle is 1.\n5. By looking at which prisoners died and which survived, the king can determine the unique binary number assigned to the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if Prisoners 1, 3, and 7 died, the binary number for the poisoned bottle would be 1010001000.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours, using only 10 prisoners.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
