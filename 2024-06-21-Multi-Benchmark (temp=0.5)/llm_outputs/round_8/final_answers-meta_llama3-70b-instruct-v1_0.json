A and B: A takes 1 minute, B takes 2 minutes, so the total time for this pair is 2 minutes. Then, one of them (A) must come back with the torch, taking another minute. Total time so far: 3 minutes.\n2. C and D: C takes 5 minutes, D takes 10 minutes, so the total time for this pair is 10 minutes. Then, one of them (C) must come back with the torch, taking another 5 minutes. Total time so far: 15 minutes.\n3. Now, the remaining two people (A and C) can cross together. A takes 1 minute, C takes 5 minutes, so the total time for this pair is 5 minutes.\n\nAdding up the times, we get: 3 minutes + 15 minutes + 5 minutes = 23 minutes. However, we can optimize this by noticing that when C comes back with the torch, A can immediately start crossing again, saving 1 minute. So, the total time is: 3 minutes + 15 minutes + 4 minutes = 22 minutes.\n\nBut wait, there's another way to pair them up:\n\n1.

Then, one of them (B) must come back with the torch, taking another 2 minutes. Total time so far: 18 minutes.\n3. Now, the remaining two people (A and B) can cross together. A takes 1 minute, B takes 2 minutes, so the total time for this pair is 2 minutes.\n\nAdding up the times, we get: 6 minutes + 18 minutes + 2 minutes = 26 minutes.

We need to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours, and we have 10 prisoners to help us.\n\nOption A is not efficient, as we would need to test 100 bottles per prisoner, which would take too long.\n\nOption B is not possible, as the poison takes effect 24 hours after consumption, so the prisoners wouldn't be able to taste the bitterness immediately.\n\nOption C is not practical, as it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is not feasible.\n\nOption D is the correct answer. By using a binary search strategy, we can minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles into two groups of 500 each.\n2. Have one prisoner drink from one group, and another prisoner drink from the other group.\n3. Wait 24 hours. If one prisoner dies, the poisoned bottle is in the group he drank from. If neither dies, the poisoned bottle is in the other group.\n4. Repeat the process with the remaining group, dividing it into two subgroups of 250 each, and so on.\n5. After 10 rounds of testing (using all 10 prisoners), we can narrow down the poisoned bottle to one of two possibilities.\n6. Finally, have one prisoner drink from one of the remaining two bottles, and if he dies, we know the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis strategy takes advantage of the binary nature of the problem, using the prisoners to test large groups of bottles and then narrowing down the search.

This is known as the \"birthday problem\".\n\nLet's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n\nWhen there's only 1 person in the room, the probability that they have a specific birthday is 1\/365. When there are 2 people, the probability that they share a birthday is 1\/365, and the probability that they don't is 364\/365.\n\nAs we add more people to the room, the probability that at least two people share a birthday increases. With 3 people, the probability that they all have different birthdays is (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365), since the third person can't have the same birthday as either of the first two.\n\nUsing this logic, we can calculate the probability that all people in the room have different birthdays for different group sizes. Then, we can subtract this probability from 1 to get the probability that at least two people share a birthday.\n\nAfter doing these calculations, we find that with 23 pairs of twins (46 people), the probability that at least two people share a birthday is approximately 50.7%.
