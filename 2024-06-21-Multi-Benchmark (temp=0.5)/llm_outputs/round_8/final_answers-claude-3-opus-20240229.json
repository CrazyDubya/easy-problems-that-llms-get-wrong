By treating the prisoners as 'bits' in a 10-bit binary number, we can map each bottle to a unique binary string. Each prisoner drinks from the bottles corresponding to their assigned '1' bits. After 24 hours, the prisoners still alive represent '0' bits and the dead represent '1' bits, forming a 10-bit binary number that identifies the poisoned bottle number.
