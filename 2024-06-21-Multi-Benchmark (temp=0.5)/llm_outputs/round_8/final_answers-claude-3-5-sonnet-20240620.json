If we race all 6 horses at once, we would only know the order of the top 5, but not where the 6th horse fits in.\n\n4. So, we need at least two races:\n   - Race 1: Run 5 horses (let's call them A, B, C, D, E)\n   - Race 2: Run the winner of Race 1 along with the horse that didn't race (F) and any other necessary horses\n\n5.

Tasting for bitterness won't work because the poison is described as \"very bitter,\" implying it might not be detectable by taste.\n5. Having all prisoners sample each bottle would be inefficient and wouldn't work within the time constraint.\n\nThe most efficient solution is to use a binary system. Here's how it works:\n\n1.

Infinitely fast\nC. 6mph\nD. 12mph\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Let's say the distance to your friend's house is x miles.\n\n2. At 3 mph, the time to walk there is x\/3 hours.\n\n3. Let's say the speed to run back is y mph. The time to run back would be x\/y hours.\n\n4. The total time for the round trip is (x\/3 + x\/y) hours.\n\n5. The total distance for the round trip is 2x miles.\n\n6. The average speed for the entire trip needs to be 6 mph (double the walking speed).\n\n7. We can set up the equation: 2x \/ (x\/3 + x\/y) = 6\n\n8. Simplifying: 12 = 6\/3 + 6\/y\n\n9. Solving for y: y = 6\n\nThis means you would need to run back at 6 mph to make the average speed for the entire trip 6 mph (double your walking speed).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. 6mph.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""}}
