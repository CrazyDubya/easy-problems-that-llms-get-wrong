Many common words like \"love,\" \"peace,\" \"king,\" \"water,\" and even seemingly simple ones like \"the,\" \"and,\" \"it\" appear in the Bible.  This makes finding a sentence with entirely non-biblical words surprisingly tricky.\n\n**Analyzing the Options:**\n\n* **A. Cryptographic algorithms safeguard nuclear warheads.**  Words like \"safeguard\" and \"nuclear\" are likely not in the Bible due to their modern context. However, \"algorithms\" and \"warheads\" are derived from concepts (mathematics and weapons) that existed in biblical times, making their root words' presence in the Bible possible.\n\n* **B. Our computer, engineered in a contemporary lab, processes data flawlessly and efficiently.**  This option is full of modern technical terms. \"Computer,\" \"engineered,\" \"contemporary,\" \"lab,\" \"processes,\" \"data,\" \"flawlessly,\" and \"efficiently\" are all highly likely to be absent from the Bible.\n\n* **C. The computer swiftly executed complex algorithms.** This option shares similar reasoning with option B, featuring modern and technical terms like \"computer,\" \"executed,\" and \"algorithms.\"\n\n* **D. Quixotic zephyrs vexed the jabberwocky's kumquat garden.** This sentence is intentionally crafted with unusual and whimsical words. While \"garden\" appears in the Bible, the other words like \"quixotic,\" \"zephyrs,\" \"vexed,\" \"jabberwocky,\" and \"kumquat\" are highly improbable to be found within its pages.\n\n**The Best Choice:**\n\nOptions B, C, and D all have strong arguments.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"D\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is D and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:** Identify one poisoned bottle out of 1000 within 24 hours.\n* **The Constraint:** Each prisoner can only provide one data point (live or die after 24 hours).\n\n**Solution: Binary Search**\n\n1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each bottle a number from 1 to 1000. Convert each bottle's number into its binary representation (up to 10 digits since 2^10 = 1024). \n2. **Prisoners as Bits:** Each prisoner represents a specific digit position in the binary numbers (e.g., Prisoner 1 represents the ones place, Prisoner 2 represents the twos place, and so on).\n3. **Wine Assignment:**  A prisoner drinks from a bottle if the bottle's binary representation has a '1' in the digit position that prisoner represents. For example:\n    * Bottle 5 (binary 0000000101): Prisoners 1 and 3 would drink from this bottle.\n    * Bottle 500 (binary 111110100): Prisoners 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 3 would drink from this bottle.\n4. **Decoding the Outcome:** After 24 hours:\n    * If a prisoner dies, their corresponding binary digit position is a '1'.\n    * If a prisoner lives, their corresponding binary digit position is a '0'.\n\nThis method creates a unique combination of prisoners drinking from each bottle, allowing you to pinpoint the exact poisoned bottle by analyzing who dies.\n\n**Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n* **A, B:**  Tasting is unreliable and too subjective. The poison could be tasteless or in a very small, undetectable amount.\n* **C:**  Logistically impossible. Each prisoner would have to drink from 1000 bottles, leading to certain death for all. \"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
