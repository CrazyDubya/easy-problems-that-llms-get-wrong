The classic approach to such puzzles is to use a question that neutralizes the lying\/truth-telling behavior.\n\n3. **The Key Question:**\n   - A common strategy is to ask one guardian what the other guardian would say if asked which door leads to freedom. This works because:\n     - If you ask the truth-telling guardian (Guardian 1), he will truthfully tell you what the lying guardian (Guardian 2) would say, which would be a lie.\n     - If you ask the lying guardian (Guardian 2), he will lie about what the truth-telling guardian (Guardian 1) would say, which would also be a lie.\n\n   Therefore, both scenarios lead you to the door that the lying guardian would indicate, which is the death door. Hence, you should choose the opposite door to ensure freedom.\n\n**Example Question:** \"If I asked the other guardian which door leads to freedom, which door would he point to?\"\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Asking either guardian this question will always point you to the death door, so you should choose the opposite door to ensure freedom.\n\nThus, the minimum number of questions needed to determine the door to freedom is one.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"16":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"You have 3 switches in front of you - A, B and C.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"To solve this problem efficiently, we need to minimize the number of tests while ensuring we can identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours. Given that we have 10 prisoners and 1000 bottles, we can use a strategy that leverages binary numbers.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Binary Representation**: Each of the 1000 bottles can be represented as a unique binary number from 0000000000 (0) to 1111101000 (999). This is because 1000 bottles can be represented using 10 bits (since 2^10 = 1024, which is more than 1000).\n\n2. **Assigning Prisoners**: Each prisoner can be thought of as representing one bit in the binary representation of the bottle numbers. For example, prisoner 1 represents the least significant bit (2^0), prisoner 2 represents the second least significant bit (2^1), and so on up to prisoner 10, who represents the most significant bit (2^9).\n\n3. **Testing Strategy**: Each prisoner will drink from bottles where their corresponding bit in the binary representation is '1'. For instance, prisoner 1 will drink from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7, etc. (all odd-numbered bottles), prisoner 2 will drink from bottles 2, 3, 6, 7, etc. (every second bottle), and so on.\n\n4. **Identifying the Poisoned Bottle**: After 24 hours, the combination of prisoners who die will give a binary number. Converting this binary number to a decimal number will directly identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nThis method ensures that we can identify the poisoned bottle using the minimum number of tests and within the given time frame.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Another option not stated.\n- This is a placeholder for any other method not listed. We need to check if there is a simpler method from the given options first.\n\nD. Filling the 5-gallon jug and pouring it into the 4-gallon jug.\n- This method would leave exactly 1 gallon in the 5-gallon jug after filling the 4-gallon jug. However, this does not help us measure exactly 4 gallons.\n\nFrom the analysis, option A is the simplest and most efficient way to measure exactly 4 gallons, as the 4-gallon jug can hold the total amount.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"28":{"category":"Popular science","question":"A 2kg tree grows in a planted pot with 10kg of soil.

In reality, trees primarily grow by absorbing water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients from the soil, but the mass of the tree does not come solely from the soil itself. Most of the tree's mass comes from carbon dioxide absorbed from the air during photosynthesis.\n\nTherefore, the amount of soil in the pot would not significantly decrease as the tree grows. The soil might lose some nutrients, but its mass would remain nearly the same.\n\nGiven this understanding, the correct answer is that the amount of soil left is still 10kg.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"ANSWER\": \"C\"\n}\n```","score":""},"29":{"category":"Relational","question":"A man steps over a 0.5m hurdle.

Let's assume the distance to your friend's house is \\(d\\) miles.\n2. You walk to your friend's house at 3 mph.\n\nThe time taken to walk to your friend's house is:\n\\[ t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n3.

The total distance for the round trip is:\n\\[ 2d \\text{ miles} \\]\n\n5. The total time for the round trip to achieve an average speed of 6 mph must be:\n\\[ t_{total} = \\frac{2d}{6} = \\frac{d}{3} \\text{ hours} \\]\n\n6. We already know that the time taken to walk to your friend's house is \\( \\frac{d}{3} \\text{ hours} \\).\n\n7. Therefore, the time left to run back must be:\n\\[ t_2 = t_{total} - t_1 = \\frac{d}{3} - \\frac{d}{3} = 0 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nThis means you would need to run back in zero time, which is impossible. Therefore, you would need to run back at an infinitely fast speed.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""}}
