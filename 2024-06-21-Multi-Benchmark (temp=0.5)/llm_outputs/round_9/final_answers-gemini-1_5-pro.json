The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nD. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"B\",\n \"Explanation\": \"Here's why the answer is B and how it works:\n\n* **A is incorrect** This method is highly inefficient and inhumane, leading to unnecessary deaths. \n* **C is incorrect**  This approach would likely kill all the prisoners as the poison is only lethal after 24 hours. They wouldn't die immediately from a sip.\n* **D is incorrect** The problem states the wine is sweet, implying the poison doesn't alter the taste.\n\n**B is the most efficient and humane solution:**\n\n1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10. Convert each prisoner's number to its binary equivalent (e.g., Prisoner 1 is 001, Prisoner 2 is 010, Prisoner 3 is 011, etc.).  Similarly, number the wine bottles from 1 to 1000 and convert them to their binary equivalents.\n\n2. **Tasting Strategy:** Each prisoner will drink from bottles based on their corresponding binary digit.  For example:\n    * Prisoner 1 (001) drinks from bottles where the *last* binary digit is a 1.\n    * Prisoner 2 (010) drinks from bottles where the *second to last* binary digit is a 1.\n    * Prisoner 3 (011) drinks from bottles where the *last* binary digit OR the *second to last* binary digit is a 1. \n\n3. **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, observe which prisoners have died. Construct a binary number where:\n    * '1' represents a dead prisoner.\n    * '0' represents a living prisoner.\n\n    This resulting binary number, when converted to decimal, will be the number of the poisoned bottle.\n\n**Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 011001, which translates to 25 in decimal. Therefore, bottle number 25 is poisoned.\n\n**Why this works:** The binary system allows us to test a large number of possibilities with a small number of tests.  Each prisoner represents a 'bit' of information, and their survival or death helps pinpoint the poisoned bottle.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
