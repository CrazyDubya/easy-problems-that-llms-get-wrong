The optimal question would be: \"If I asked the other guardian which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\n4. If we ask this to the truthful guardian:\n   - They would truthfully tell us what the lying guardian would say.\n   - The lying guardian would point to the death door (lying about the freedom door).\n   - So the truthful guardian would point to the death door.\n\n5.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"A","model_answer":"Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Let's say the distance to your friend's house is x miles.\n\n2. At 3 mph, the time to walk there is x\/3 hours.\n\n3. We want the average speed for the entire trip to be 6 mph (double the walking speed).\n\n4. For an average speed of 6 mph, the total time for the round trip should be 2x\/6 = x\/3 hours.\n\n5. But we've already spent x\/3 hours walking there. So we have no time left for the return trip!\n\n6. No matter how fast we run back, we can't make the average speed for the entire trip 6 mph.\n\n7. The only way to achieve this would be if we could run back instantaneously, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, there is no finite speed at which you could run back to achieve an average speed of 6 mph for the entire trip. The correct answer is that you would need to run infinitely fast.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""}}
