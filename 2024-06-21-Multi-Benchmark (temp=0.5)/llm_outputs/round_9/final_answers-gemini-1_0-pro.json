You must walk into another room to observe the bulbs:** This is unnecessary as the light bulbs are visible in the same room. \n* **B. Turning two switches on for a while, turn one off, then touching the bulbs to see which is warm and which one is on:** This method is flawed because LED bulbs do not emit heat when turned on. \n* **C. Turning all of the switches on at once and observing the bulbs:** This could potentially identify which switch turns on which bulb, but it wouldn't be as efficient as turning them on one at a time. Additionally, if two switches control the same bulb, this method wouldn't be able to differentiate between them. \n\nTherefore, the most efficient and accurate approach is to turn each switch on one at a time and observe the corresponding bulb. \n\n## Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n``` \n","score":""},"17":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"The Poisoned Wine - A king has 1000 sweet bottles of wine, and one contains a very bitter poison.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"## The Fastest Way to Identify the Poisoned Wine\n\nThe optimal solution to identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours lies in option B: **using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners**. This approach leverages the power of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests required.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Label the bottles:** Assign a unique binary number (from 0 to 999) to each bottle. Each digit in the binary representation corresponds to a prisoner.\n2. **First round:** Give each prisoner a sip from the bottles corresponding to the \"1\" in their assigned binary number. For example, prisoner 1 would taste from bottles 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.\n3. **Observe and record:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners are alive and which are dead.\n4. **Refine the search:** Based on the survival pattern, eliminate half of the remaining bottles. If all prisoners are alive, the poisoned bottle is among those they didn't taste (with a \"0\" in their binary code). Conversely, if some prisoners are dead, the poisoned bottle is among those they tasted (with a \"1\").\n5. **Repeat:** Repeat steps 2-4 with the remaining bottles, assigning new binary combinations based on the updated \"0\" and \"1\" values. With each round, the pool of potential poisoned bottles is halved, leading to a rapid identification.\n\nThis binary search strategy offers several advantages:\n\n* **Efficiency:** It minimizes the number of tastings required compared to other options. With 10 prisoners, you can identify the poisoned bottle in a maximum of 10 rounds (2^10 = 1024), which is significantly faster than individually testing each bottle.\n* **Scalability:** This approach can be easily adapted for different scenarios with varying numbers of prisoners and bottles.\n* **Flexibility:** The binary search can be adjusted to accommodate different information. For instance, if the prisoners can distinguish the taste of the poison, their feedback can be incorporated to further refine the search.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
