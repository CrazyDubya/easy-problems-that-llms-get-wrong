Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"Here's my explanation and answer:\n\nThe key to this problem is to understand that the king has a limited number of prisoners (10) and a limited amount of time (24 hours) to identify the poisoned bottle. The king needs to use a strategy that minimizes the number of tests needed to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nOption A is not feasible because it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles of wine, which is impractical and would likely take more than 24 hours.\n\nOption C is also not effective because dividing the bottles amongst the prisoners would still require a large number of tests, and there's no guarantee that the poisoned bottle would be identified.\n\nOption D is not a viable solution because the poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption, so the prisoners wouldn't be able to taste the bitterness immediately.\n\nOption B is the correct answer because it leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n* Assign a binary number to each prisoner, from 1 to 10 (2^10 = 1024, which is greater than 1000).\n* Have each prisoner sample a subset of bottles corresponding to their binary number. For example, prisoner 1 samples bottles 1, 3, 5, ..., prisoner 2 samples bottles 2, 3, 6, ..., and so on.\n* After 24 hours, the prisoners who die indicate which bottles contain the poison. By analyzing the binary numbers of the dead prisoners, the king can identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nFor example, if prisoners 1, 3, and 9 die, the king knows that the poisoned bottle is one of the bottles sampled by all three prisoners. By analyzing the binary numbers, the king can narrow down the possibilities to a single bottle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Let's assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity).\n\nFor a single pair of twins, the probability that they share the same birthday is 1, since they are twins.\n\nFor two pairs of twins, the probability that at least one pair shares the same birthday is still 1, since each pair is guaranteed to share the same birthday.\n\nHowever, as we add more pairs of twins to the room, the probability that at least two people share the same birthday increases. We can calculate this probability using the complementary probability, i.e., the probability that no two people share the same birthday.\n\nFor n pairs of twins, the probability that no two people share the same birthday is:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-2n+1)\/365)\n\nThis is because each person has a 365\/365 chance of having a unique birthday, the next person has a 364\/365 chance of having a unique birthday (since one birthday is already taken), and so on.\n\nWe want to find the smallest n such that the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday is at least 50%. This means we need to find the smallest n such that the probability of no two people sharing the same birthday is less than or equal to 50%.\n\nUsing a calculator or computer program to compute the probabilities, we find that:\n\n* For 12 pairs of twins, the probability of no two people sharing the same birthday is approximately 54.7%.\n* For 23 pairs of twins, the probability of no two people sharing the same birthday is approximately 49.4%.\n* For 46 pairs of twins, the probability of no two people sharing the same birthday is approximately 36.4%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
