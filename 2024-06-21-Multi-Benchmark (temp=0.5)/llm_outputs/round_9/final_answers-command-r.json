We can achieve this by filling the 5-gallon jug and transferring its contents into the 3-gallon jug, which holds a smaller volume. This process will inevitably result in the 3-gallon jug overflowing, indicating that it has been filled to exactly 3 gallons. We then repeat this step, filling the 5-gallon jug and transferring the water into the already full 3-gallon jug. This second transfer will displace the exact amount needed to reach 4 gallons, as the 3-gallon jug will once again overflow at exactly 4 gallons.\n```","score":""},"28":{"category":"Popular science","question":"A 2kg tree grows in a planted pot with 10kg of soil.
