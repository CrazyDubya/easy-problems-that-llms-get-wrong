Let's say the distance to your friend's house is x miles.\n\n2. At 3 mph, the time taken to walk there is x\/3 hours.\n\n3. We want the average speed for the entire trip to be 6 mph (double the walking speed).\n\n4. For an average speed of 6 mph, the total time for the round trip should be 2x\/6 = x\/3 hours.\n\n5. But we've already spent x\/3 hours walking there. This means we have no time left for the return journey if we want to maintain an average of 6 mph.\n\n6. To achieve this average speed, we would need to return instantaneously, which is impossible.\n\n7. Any finite speed for the return journey would result in an overall average speed less than 6 mph.\n\nTherefore, to double the average speed for the entire trip, you would need to run back infinitely fast, which is not physically possible.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""}}
