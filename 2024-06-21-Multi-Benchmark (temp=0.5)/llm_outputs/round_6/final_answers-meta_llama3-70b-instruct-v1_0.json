With six horses, we can't do this in just one race, as we can only compare three horses at a time. If we race three horses and get a winner, we still don't know how that winner compares to the other three horses.\n\nA good approach is to divide the horses into two groups of three and race them separately. This gives us two winners, which we can then race against each other to find the overall fastest horse.\n\nSo, we need a minimum of three races: two races to find the winners of each group, and a third race to find the overall winner.\n\nHere's my answer in JSON format:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"2":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a gold bar; behind the others, rotten vegetables.

Since the host knows what's behind each door, they will always show you a door with rotten vegetables. So, when they show you door No. 2, you know that it has rotten vegetables.

Since the poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption, we can use a binary search strategy to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle of wine with a binary number from 0 to 999 (since there are 1000 bottles).\n2. Divide the prisoners into two groups of 5.\n3. For each group, have them drink a mixture of wine from bottles with a 0 in a specific binary position (e.g., bottles 0-511 for the first group, and bottles 512-999 for the second group).\n4. Wait 24 hours and observe which group(s) die.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4, narrowing down the range of bottles by half each time, until only one bottle remains.\n\nThis strategy allows us to identify the poisoned bottle in just 10 tests (since 2^10 = 1024, which is greater than 1000).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the answer choices:\n\nA. This is the correct answer, as it describes the binary search strategy outlined above.\n\nB. This approach is inefficient and would require testing all 1000 bottles, which is not possible with only 10 prisoners.\n\nC. This approach is also inefficient and would require testing half of the bottles, which is still too many.\n\nD.

If we assume that birthdays are equally likely to occur on any of the 365 days of the year (ignoring February 29th for simplicity), then the probability that the first person has a unique birthday is 365\/365 = 1.\n\nThe probability that the second person has a different birthday from the first person is 364\/365, since there's one fewer day to choose from. The probability that the third person has a different birthday from the first two is 363\/365, and so on.\n\nThe probability that all n people have different birthdays is therefore:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365)\n\nWe want to find the smallest n such that the probability of this event is less than or equal to 50%.

This 1kg must come from the soil, as it's the only other component in the pot. Therefore, the soil must have lost 1kg.\n\nInitially, there were 10kg of soil. After the tree grows, there will be 10kg - 1kg = 9kg of soil left.\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"29":{"category":"Relational","question":"A man steps over a 0.5m hurdle.

However, this doesn't mean he needs to jump exactly 0.5m high.

I walk to my friend's house at an average speed of 3mph. This means the time it takes me to walk to my friend's house is `distance \/ 3`.\n2. I want to double my average speed for the entire trip, which means my average speed for the entire trip should be `2 * 3 = 6mph`.\n3. Since I've already walked to my friend's house at 3mph, the time it takes me to walk there is already accounted for. To double my average speed, I need to make up for the slow walking time by running back at a faster speed.\n4. Let's call the distance to my friend's house `d`. The total time for the entire trip is the sum of the time it takes to walk there and the time it takes to run back: `time_total = (d \/ 3) + (d \/ x)`, where `x` is the speed at which I need to run back.\n5. Since I want my average speed for the entire trip to be 6mph, the total time should be equal to the distance divided by 6: `time_total = d \/ 6`.\n6. Equating the two expressions for `time_total`, we get: `(d \/ 3) + (d \/ x) = d \/ 6`. Simplifying the equation, we get `x = 6mph`.\n\nSo, I need to run back at a speed of 6mph to double my average speed for the entire trip.\n\nHere's my answer in JSON format:\n\n`{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}`","score":""}}
