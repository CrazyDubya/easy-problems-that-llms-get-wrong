Here's why the best strategy is to switch doors:\n\n1. **Initial Choice:** When you initially chose Door No. 1, you had a 1\/3 chance of selecting the door with the gold bar and a 2\/3 chance of selecting a door with rotten vegetables.\n\n2. **Host's Action:** The host *always* reveals a door with rotten vegetables behind it and *always* offers you the chance to switch. This action doesn't change the initial odds that your first choice was wrong (which was 2\/3).\n\n3. **The Switch:**  The key is that the host's action concentrates the remaining probability (that 2\/3 chance of being wrong) onto the single door you didn't initially choose. By switching to Door No. 2, you're essentially taking advantage of that concentrated probability.\n\n**Therefore, switching doors doubles your chances of winning the gold bar.**\n\n## Answer:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n``` \n","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"```json\n{\n \"ANSWER\": \"A\",\n \"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's the breakdown of why the answer is A and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:** Identify one poisoned bottle out of 1000 with only 10 prisoners and 24 hours.\n\n* **Why A is Correct (Binary Search):**\n\n    1. **Numbering and Binary:** Assign each bottle a number from 1 to 1000. Convert each bottle's number into its binary representation (e.g., bottle 1 is 0000000001, bottle 2 is 0000000010, bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.).\n    2. **Prisoners as Bits:** Each prisoner represents a specific 'bit' in a 10-bit binary number (since 2^10 = 1024, which is enough to cover all 1000 bottles).\n    3. **Tasting Strategy:**  Each prisoner will drink from bottles where their corresponding 'bit' is a '1' in the bottle's binary representation. For example:\n        * Prisoner 1: Drinks from bottles with a '1' in the rightmost digit of their binary representation (1, 3, 5, 7...999)\n        * Prisoner 2: Drinks from bottles with a '1' in the second digit from the right (2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11...) \n        * and so on...\n    4. **Decoding the Result:** After 24 hours, the prisoners who drank from the poisoned bottle will die.  Create a binary number where '1' represents a dead prisoner and '0' a living one. This binary number directly translates back to the poisoned bottle's number.\n\n* **Why other options are incorrect:**\n\n    * **B:**  Impractical and dangerous.  Each prisoner would need to drink from 1000 bottles, guaranteeing death for all.\n    * **C:**  Similar to B, this leads to likely death for multiple prisoners and only provides a rough estimate of the poisoned bottle.\n    * **D:** The poison takes 24 hours to take effect; tasting it would not provide immediate results.\n\n**In summary, the binary search strategy (A) is the only method that guarantees finding the poisoned bottle within 24 hours using only the 10 prisoners.** \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
