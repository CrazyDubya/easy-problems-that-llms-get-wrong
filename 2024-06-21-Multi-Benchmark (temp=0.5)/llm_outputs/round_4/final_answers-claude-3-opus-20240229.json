The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nB. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nC.

The bottles can be divided into 10 groups of 100 each and labeled 1-10. Each prisoner samples wine from a unique combination of the groups, essentially creating a 10-bit binary number for each bottle. After 24 hours, the prisoners who sampled the poisoned wine will have died. The labels of those groups can be read as a binary number identifying the exact poisoned bottle (e.g. if prisoners 1, 4, 5 died, the 145th bottle is poisoned). This cleverly identifies the poisoned bottle with the fewest tests.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

By taking action to switch the track, you would be intervening to rescue those five individuals from imminent danger. \n\nHowever, the question does not specify whether there are any people on the other track that the trolley would be diverted to. If the other track is empty, then pulling the lever is the clear ethical choice to save five lives. But if there are people on the other track who would then be in the path of the trolley, it becomes a more complex ethical dilemma. You would have to weigh the consequences and decide whether it is ethically justified to take an action that saves a greater number of lives (the five on the main track) while sacrificing a smaller number (whoever may be on the other track).\n\nSince key information is missing to make a definitive ethical judgment, I believe this represents a classic ethical dilemma with no clear right answer. More context would be needed about who (if anyone) is on the other track. But in general, I lean towards the Utilitarian view that the most ethical choice is the one that results in the greatest good for the greatest number. Saving five lives at the cost of one life (if there is a single person on the other track) could potentially be ethically justified under that framework.
