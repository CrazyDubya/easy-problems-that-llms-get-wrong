Here's how to approach it: \\n\\n**The Logic**\\n\\n* **Focus on 'different' birthdays:** Instead of calculating the probability of a shared birthday, it's easier to calculate the probability that *everyone* has a *different* birthday. Then subtract that probability from 1 (or 100%) to get the probability of at least one shared birthday.\\n* **Twin Advantage:** Each pair of twins guarantees a shared birthday. So, we need to find how many people are needed for the probability of *no* shared birthdays to dip below 50%.\\n\\n**Calculations (Simplified)**\\n\\nWe'll use an approximation to make the math easier.  Assume a year has 365 days (ignoring leap years).\\n\\n* **1 pair of twins:** 2 people, guaranteed shared birthday (100%)\\n* **2 pairs of twins:** 4 people. Let's say the first two twins have a birthday. The third person has a 364\/365 chance of having a different birthday. The fourth person has a 363\/365 chance of having a different birthday from the first three.  The probability of all different birthdays is already quite low.\\n\\nThis pattern continues, and the probability of all different birthdays drops rapidly with each additional person.\\n\\n**The Answer**\\n\\nWhile we could do more precise calculations, 12 pairs of twins (24 people) is a reasonable estimate.  With this many people, even without the twins, the probability of a shared birthday is well over 50%.  The inclusion of twins only makes that probability even higher.\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
