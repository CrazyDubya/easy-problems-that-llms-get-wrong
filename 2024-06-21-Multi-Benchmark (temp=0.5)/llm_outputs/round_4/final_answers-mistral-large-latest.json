The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy. This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Label each bottle with a unique binary number that requires no more than 10 digits (since there are 1000 bottles and 10 prisoners). For example, the first bottle would be 0000000001, the second 0000000010, the third 0000000011, and so on up to 1111111111 for the 1023rd bottle. Note that we only need to use 10 digits because 2^10 = 1024, which is more than the number of bottles.\n\n2. For each prisoner, assign them one of the binary digits. For example, the first prisoner could be assigned the first digit, the second prisoner the second digit, and so on.\n\n3. Have each prisoner drink from the bottles where their assigned digit is a 1. For example, the first prisoner would drink from bottles 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on (since their digit is 1 in all these binary numbers).\n\n4. After 24 hours, if a prisoner dies, then the bottles they drank from contain the poison. The specific bottle can be identified by looking at the binary numbers of these bottles and seeing which one matches the pattern of living and dead prisoners.\n\nThis strategy allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one day, making it the fastest way.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
