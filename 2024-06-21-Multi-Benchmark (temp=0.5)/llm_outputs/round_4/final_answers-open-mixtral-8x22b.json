Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"B\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy. This strategy minimizes the number of tests needed and allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in 24 hours.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Divide the 1000 bottles of wine into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to one of the 10 prisoners.\n3. Have each prisoner drink from the bottles in their assigned group.\n4. Wait 24 hours to see which prisoners, if any, are affected by the poison.\n5. If none of the prisoners are affected, then the poisoned bottle is in the group that was not assigned to any prisoner. If one prisoner is affected, then the poisoned bottle is in their assigned group.\n6. Repeat the process with the remaining bottles in the affected group, dividing them into smaller groups and assigning them to the remaining prisoners.\n\nThis process can be repeated until the poisoned bottle is identified. Using a binary search strategy, the king can identify the poisoned bottle in at most 10 rounds of testing (since 2^10 > 1000).\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it would require all 1000 bottles to be tested, which would take too long. Answer C is incorrect because it would not identify the poisoned bottle in time. Answer D is incorrect because it would result in the death of one or more prisoners, which is not necessary to identify the poisoned bottle.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
