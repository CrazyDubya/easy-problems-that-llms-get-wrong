Importantly, the host's offer implies that Door No. 3 contains a rotten vegetable (since the host would never reveal the gold bar).\n\n### Probabilities:\n- **Initial Probability:** When you first pick Door No. 1, the probability of the gold bar being behind Door No. 1 is 1\/3, and the probability of it being behind one of the other two doors (Door No. 2 or Door No. 3) is 2\/3.\n- **Host's Knowledge:** The host's offer to switch to Door No. 2 means that Door No. 3 must have a rotten vegetable. This means the 2\/3 probability of the gold bar being behind one of the other two doors is now entirely on Door No. 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Switching Doors:** By switching to Door No. 2, you effectively capitalize on the 2\/3 probability that the gold bar is behind one of the other doors.\n- **Staying with Initial Choice:** Staying with Door No. 1 keeps you at the initial 1\/3 probability of winning.\n\nThus, switching to Door No. 2 gives you a higher probability of winning the gold bar.\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n```","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Since he survived, we know that the chamber he fired was the one empty chamber.\n\nNow, there are five chambers left, and four of them contain bullets.

The man must jump at least the height of the hurdle to clear it. Therefore, the minimum height he could have jumped is equal to the height of the hurdle.\n\nLet's analyze the options provided:\n\nA. Slightly higher than 0.5m - This is not the minimum height as \"slightly higher\" implies a height greater than 0.5m.\nB. 0m - This is incorrect because he must jump to clear the hurdle.\nC. Between 0.1m and 0.5m - This is incorrect because the minimum height must be at least 0.5m.\nD. 0.5m - This is correct because the minimum height to clear a 0.5m hurdle is exactly 0.5m.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}\n```","score":""},"30":{"category":"Popular science","question":"I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.
