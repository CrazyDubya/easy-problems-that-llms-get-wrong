Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"C","model_answer":"Here's my explanation and answer:\n\nThe key to this problem is to use the prisoners efficiently to identify the poisoned bottle within the 24-hour time constraint. Option A is not feasible as it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is impractical and would likely result in many deaths.\n\nOption C is also not the best approach, as the poison takes effect after 24 hours, so the prisoners wouldn't be able to taste the bitterness immediately.\n\nOption D is similar to Option A, but with each prisoner sampling a subset of bottles. However, this approach is still inefficient and would likely result in multiple deaths.\n\nThe most efficient approach is Option B, which uses a binary search strategy to minimize the number of tests needed. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Assign each prisoner a unique binary number from 0 to 9 (e.g., 0000 to 1001).\n2. Label each bottle of wine with a binary number from 0 to 999 (e.g., 0000000000 to 1111101000).\n3. Have each prisoner drink from the bottles that correspond to their binary number. For example, prisoner 0000 would drink from bottles 0000000000, 0000000001, ..., 0000001000, while prisoner 1001 would drink from bottles 1001000000, 1001000001, ..., 1001001000.\n4. After 24 hours, observe which prisoners have died. The binary numbers of the dead prisoners will indicate which bottles contain the poison.\n5. By analyzing the binary numbers of the dead prisoners, the king can identify the poisoned bottle. For example, if prisoners 0000, 0010, and 1001 died, the king would know that the poisoned bottle is 0001000000.\n\nThis approach ensures that the king can identify the poisoned bottle within 24 hours using only 10 prisoners.\n\nHere's my answer in JSON format:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible.","'Dogs bark with me.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The probability that a single person has a unique birthday (i.e., no one else shares their birthday) is `(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365)`, since there are 365 possible birthdays, and each person's birthday is independent of the others.\n\nNow, the probability that all `n` people have unique birthdays is the product of these individual probabilities. We want to find the smallest `n` such that this probability is less than or equal to 50%, which means the probability that at least one pair shares a birthday is greater than or equal to 50%.\n\nUsing some math and approximations, we can show that this happens when `n` is around 23. In fact, with 23 people, the probability that at least one pair shares a birthday is approximately 50.7%.\n\nSo, to answer the question, we don't need pairs of twins; we just need individual people.
