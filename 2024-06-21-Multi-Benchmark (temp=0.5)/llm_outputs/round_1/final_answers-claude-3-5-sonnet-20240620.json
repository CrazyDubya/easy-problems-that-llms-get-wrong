We can do this by asking about what the other guard would say.\n\nHere's the optimal question to ask either guard:\n\"If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to freedom, what would they say?\"\n\nLet's break down why this works:\n1. If you ask the truthful guard, they will honestly tell you what the lying guard would say. The lying guard would point to the death door, so the truthful guard would point to the death door.\n2. If you ask the lying guard, they will lie about what the truthful guard would say.

We have 10 prisoners available for testing.\n4. There are 1000 bottles to test.\n\nThe key to solving this efficiently is to use the binary system. With 10 prisoners, we can represent 2^10 = 1024 different combinations, which is enough to cover all 1000 bottles.\n\nHere's how it would work:\n1. Assign each bottle a unique binary number from 0 to 999.\n2. Each prisoner represents a bit in this 10-digit binary number.\n3.

Let's say the distance to your friend's house is x miles.\n\n2. At 3 mph, the time taken to walk there is x\/3 hours.\n\n3. Let's say the speed to run back is y mph. The time taken to run back would be x\/y hours.\n\n4. The total distance covered is 2x miles (x there and x back).\n\n5. The total time taken is (x\/3 + x\/y) hours.\n\n6. We want the average speed for the entire trip to be 6 mph (double the walking speed).\n\n7. Average speed = Total distance \/ Total time\n   6 = 2x \/ (x\/3 + x\/y)\n\n8. Solving this equation:\n   6(x\/3 + x\/y) = 2x\n   2x + 2x\/y = x\n   2 + 2\/y = 1\n   2\/y = -1\n   y = -2\n\n9. However, speed can't be negative. This means there's no finite speed that satisfies the condition.\n\nTherefore, to double the average speed for the entire trip, you would need to run back infinitely fast.\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""}}
