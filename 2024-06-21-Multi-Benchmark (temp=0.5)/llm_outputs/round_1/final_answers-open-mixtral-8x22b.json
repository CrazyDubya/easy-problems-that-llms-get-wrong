What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nC.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"{\n  \"ANSWER\": \"A\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe king can use a binary search strategy to identify the poisoned bottle quickly. This can be done by assigning each prisoner a unique binary number from 0 to 1023 (10 prisoners, each with a unique 10-bit binary number). Then, the king will give each prisoner a sip of wine from the bottles corresponding to the 1s in their binary number.\n\nFor example, prisoner 1 (binary 001) will drink from bottle 1, prisoner 2 (binary 010) will drink from bottle 2, prisoner 3 (binary 011) will drink from bottles 1 and 2, and so on.\n\nAfter 24 hours, the king can identify the poisoned bottle by looking at which prisoners are still alive. If any prisoner with a 1 in a particular position is dead, then the corresponding bottle is poisoned. This strategy will allow the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just 24 hours, as he will be able to infer the poisoned bottle based on the prisoners' survival status.\n\nAnswer A is the fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle, as it minimizes the number of tests needed and provides results in 24 hours.\n\nAnswer B is not feasible because the poison is bitter, and the king needs to find the poisoned bottle before the event.\n\nAnswer C is not ethical, as it involves letting prisoners die.\n\nAnswer D is not feasible because it involves giving all prisoners a sip of each bottle, which would be time-consuming and could lead to multiple prisoners dying.","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

The birthday paradox states that in a group of at least 23 people, there is a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday. However, this problem is slightly different because it involves pairs of twins.\n\nSince each pair of twins shares the same birthday, we only need to consider the number of pairs of twins, not the total number of people. Therefore, we can think of each pair of twins as a single unit with a unique birthday.\n\nTo have at least a 50% chance that two people (or in this case, two pairs of twins) have the same birthday, we would need half the number of pairs of twins as we would need individual people in the birthday paradox scenario.\n\nSo, if we needed 23 people to have a 50% chance of a shared birthday, we would only need half that number of pairs of twins, which is 11.5 pairs.
