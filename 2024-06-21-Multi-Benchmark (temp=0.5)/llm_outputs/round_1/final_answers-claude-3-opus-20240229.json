By treating each prisoner as a binary digit, you can uniquely identify up to 2^10 (1024) bottles with just 10 prisoners. For example, prisoner 1 drinks from bottles 1,3,5,7..., prisoner 2 from bottles 2,3,6,7... and so on.

Not pulling the lever would lead to their deaths. So pulling the lever has a major positive impact on the five people by saving their lives.
