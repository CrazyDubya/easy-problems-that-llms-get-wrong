Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"```json\n{\n\"ANSWER\": \"A\",\n\"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the answer is A and how it works:\n\n* **The Goal:** Identify the single poisoned bottle out of 1000.\n* **The Constraint:**  You only have time for one round of testing before needing the results.\n\n**Why A (Binary Search) is the Best Solution:**\n\n1. **Efficiency:** Binary search is famous for its speed in finding a specific item in a sorted set. While the bottles aren't sorted, we can apply the binary principle.\n\n2. **How it Works:**\n   * **Number the Prisoners:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.\n   * **Number the Bottles:**  Imagine each bottle numbered from 1 to 1000 in binary (e.g., bottle 1 is 0000000001, bottle 2 is 0000000010, bottle 8 is 0000001000, etc.).\n   * **Assign Wine Based on Binary:** Each prisoner drinks from bottles where their corresponding binary digit is a '1'. For example:\n      * Prisoner 1: Drinks from bottles where the *rightmost* binary digit is a '1' (1, 3, 5, 7... 999).\n      * Prisoner 2: Drinks from bottles where the *second from the right* binary digit is a '1' (2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11...). \n      * ...and so on.\n   * **Decoding the Results:** After 24 hours, the dead prisoners represent '1' bits, and the living prisoners represent '0' bits. Construct a binary number based on this. This binary number will be the decimal number of the poisoned bottle.\n\n**Why Other Options Fail:**\n\n* **B:** Tasting the poison is unreliable. It might be tasteless, or the prisoner might not notice a subtle difference.\n* **C & D:** These methods would require far more than 10 prisoners to test all 1000 bottles individually. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
