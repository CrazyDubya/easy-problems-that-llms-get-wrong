Since the poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption, we can use a binary search strategy to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nHere's how it works: each prisoner can be used to test two bottles of wine at a time. If a prisoner drinks from two bottles and dies, we know one of those two bottles is poisoned. If a prisoner drinks from two bottles and doesn't die, we know both bottles are safe.\n\nUsing 10 prisoners, we can test 2^10 = 1024 combinations of bottles, which is more than enough to cover the 1000 bottles of wine.

The probability that the second person has a different birthday than the first person is (365-1)\/365 = 364\/365. The probability that both people have different birthdays is therefore (364\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u2248 0.992.\n\nFor three people, the probability that all three have different birthdays is (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 (362\/365) \u2248 0.992 \u00d7 0.991 \u2248 0.983.\n\nNotice a pattern? As we add more people to the room, the probability of all of them having different birthdays decreases rapidly.\n\nTo find the number of pairs of twins (i.e., people) needed for at least a 50% chance of two people sharing a birthday, we can use the following approximation:\n\nLet p(n) be the probability that at least two people share a birthday in a room of n people. Then, p(n) \u2248 1 - (365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-n+1)\/365).\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate that p(23) \u2248 0.507, which means that with 23 people in the room, there's at least a 50% chance that two people share a birthday.\n\nNow, since we're asked about pairs of twins, we need to double the number of people to get the number of pairs: 23 people \u2192 23\/2 = 11.5 pairs, which we can round up to 12 pairs (since we can't have a fraction of a pair!).\n\nSo, my answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"C\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
