Therefore, he must jump at least slightly higher than the height of the hurdle to ensure he clears it without touching it.\n\nHere\u2019s the reasoning for each option:\n\n- **A. 0m**: This is incorrect because 0m means he didn't jump at all, which would not allow him to clear the 0.5m hurdle.\n- **B. Slightly higher than 0.5m**: This is correct because in order to clear the hurdle, he must jump slightly higher than 0.5m.\n- **C. Between 0.1m and 0.5m**: This is incorrect because any height less than 0.5m would not allow him to clear the hurdle.\n- **D. 0.5m**: This is incorrect because jumping exactly 0.5m might not be sufficient to clear the hurdle without touching it.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}\n```","score":""},"30":{"category":"Popular science","question":"I walk to my friend's house, averaging 3mph.
