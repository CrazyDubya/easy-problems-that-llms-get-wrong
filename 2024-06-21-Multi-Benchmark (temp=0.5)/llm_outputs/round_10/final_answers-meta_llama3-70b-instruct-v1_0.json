Since the poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption, we can use a binary search strategy to identify the poisoned bottle.\n\nHere's how it works: each prisoner can be used to test two bottles of wine. If a prisoner drinks from two bottles and dies, we know one of those two bottles is poisoned. If a prisoner drinks from two bottles and doesn't die, we know neither of those two bottles is poisoned. By using this strategy, we can test 2^10 = 1024 bottles of wine with just 10 prisoners.\n\nTo implement this strategy, we can assign each prisoner a unique binary number from 0 to 9 (e.g., 0000000000 to 1000000000). Then, we have each prisoner drink from the bottles corresponding to the 1's in their binary number. For example, prisoner 0000000001 would drink from bottles 1 and 1001, prisoner 0000000010 would drink from bottles 2 and 1002, and so on.\n\nAfter 24 hours, we can use the results to identify the poisoned bottle. If a prisoner dies, we know the poisoned bottle is one of the two bottles they drank from. If a prisoner doesn't die, we know neither of the two bottles they drank from is poisoned. By combining the results from all 10 prisoners, we can narrow down the possibilities to a single bottle.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

We want to find the smallest n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%.\n\nWe can approach this problem by calculating the probability of the opposite event: that no two people share a birthday. If we can find the probability of this event, we can subtract it from 1 to get the probability that at least two people share a birthday.\n\nThe probability that the first person has a unique birthday is 1 (since there are 365 possible birthdays). The probability that the second person has a unique birthday (different from the first person) is 364\/365. The probability that the third person has a unique birthday (different from the first two) is 363\/365, and so on.\n\nSince we have 2n people, the probability that all 2n people have unique birthdays is:\n\n(365\/365) \u00d7 (364\/365) \u00d7 (363\/365) \u00d7 ... \u00d7 ((365-2n+1)\/365)\n\nWe want to find the smallest n such that the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is at least 50%.
