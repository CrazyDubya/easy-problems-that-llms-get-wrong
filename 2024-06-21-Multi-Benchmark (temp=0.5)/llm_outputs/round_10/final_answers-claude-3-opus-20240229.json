For example, if we split the horses into two groups of 3, the winners of each race could be the two fastest, but we wouldn't know which of those two is the absolute fastest.\n\nThe minimum number of races needed is three:\n\n1. Divide the 6 horses into 3 pairs. Race each pair. This gives us 3 winners.\n\n2. Race the 3 winners from the first round. This will give us the fastest of those 3.\n\n3. But one of the 3 losers from the first round could still be faster than the 2 losers from the second round.

And having them identify the bitter tasting one (answer D) assumes the poison can be tasted, which is not stated.\n\nThe best approach is to use a binary search strategy (answer A). This involves numbering the bottles from 0 to 999 and representing each number in binary format. Each prisoner is assigned a bit position. They sample the wine from bottles where their bit is a 1. \n\nAfter 24 hours, the prisoners who sampled the poisoned wine will have died.
