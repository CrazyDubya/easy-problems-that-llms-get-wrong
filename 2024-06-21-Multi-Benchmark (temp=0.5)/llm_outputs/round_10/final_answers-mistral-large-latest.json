The key to this problem is that the host knows what's behind each door and will always open a door with rotten vegetables, if possible.\n\nInitially, the probability of the gold bar being behind each door is equal (1\/3). When you choose a door, say Door No. 1, there's a 1\/3 chance that it has the gold bar. The other two doors combined also have a 1\/3 chance each, but since the host will always reveal rotten vegetables, the probability shifts.\n\nAfter the host reveals rotten vegetables behind, say, Door No. 3, the probability that the gold bar is behind Door No. 2 increases to 2\/3, because it had 1\/3 initially and now it absorbs the 1\/3 probability from Door No. 3 (since Door No. 3 is revealed to have rotten vegetables).\n\nSo, the best choice is to switch your choice to Door No. 2.\n\nHere is the answer in JSON format:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"3":{"category":"Spatial","question":"You are playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"D","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy. This strategy leverages the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. Each prisoner can be thought of as a bit in a binary number, and each bottle can be represented by a unique 10-bit binary number. By giving each prisoner a sip from the bottles corresponding to the position of their \"bit\" in the binary number, the king can identify the poisoned bottle based on which prisoners fall ill.\n\nFor example, if the prisoners who represent bits 2 and 8 fall ill, the king would know that the poisoned bottle is represented by the binary number 1010 (2^2 + 2^8 = 10). This method allows the king to identify the poisoned bottle in just one round of testing, with results available in 24 hours.\n\nOption B is not feasible because it would require each prisoner to sample all 1000 bottles, which is not only impractical but also potentially lethal for all prisoners.\n\nOption C is not efficient because it would only identify one poisoned bottle per round of testing. If the poisoned bottle is not found in the first round, the king would need to conduct additional rounds of testing, which could take more than 24 hours.\n\nOption D is not valid because the poison is not bitter-tasting until 24 hours after consumption.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The five boxers jog quick.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","No such sentence is possible.","'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

In the classic birthday problem, you're looking for the probability that at least two people in a group have the same birthday.

This is because if we count the twins' shared birthdays, the probability would always be 100% as long as there's at least one pair of twins.\n\nSo, let's ignore the fact that they're twins for a moment and treat them as individual people. The classic birthday problem tells us that we need 23 people for there to be at least a 50% chance that two people have the same birthday.\n\nSince twins come in pairs, we would need 23\/2 = 11.5 pairs of twins. But since we can't have half a pair, we'll need to round up to ensure we have at least a 50% chance.\n\nSo, we need 12 pairs of twins.\n\nHere's the answer in JSON format:\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
