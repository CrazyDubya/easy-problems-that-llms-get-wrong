Divide the horses into three pairs and race them (three races). The winners of these races then race in a final fourth race. However, to determine the second-fastest horse, you need one more race between the two horses that lost to the winner in the first round but had the fastest times. So, a minimum of five races are needed to determine the fastest and second-fastest horses.\n\nHowever, the question only asks for the minimum number of races needed to find the fastest horse, which is three races to determine the finalists and a fourth race to find the fastest horse. Therefore, the minimum number of races needed is three. But since the given options do not include three as a choice, the closest correct answer is \"C. Three\" (which is not an option), but among the given options, the next best answer would be \"C. Three\" if it were available or \"D.

Divide the 1000 bottles into 10 groups of 100 bottles each.\n2. Assign each group to a prisoner and have them taste a bottle from their group.\n3. Wait for 24 hours.
