The poison takes effect exactly 24 hours after consumption. The king needs to find the poisoned bottle in 24 hours for an event. He has 10 prisoners to test the wine. What is the fastest way for him to identify the poisoned bottle?\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to take a sip and note which one dies in 24 hours.\nB. Divide the bottles of wine amongst the prisoners and get them to note which one tastes bitter.\nC. Get all of the prisoners to sample each of the bottles of wine and see who dies in 24 hours.\nD.

Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"The fastest way for the king to identify the poisoned bottle is by using a binary search strategy. This strategy allows him to test multiple bottles at once and eliminate large groups of bottles in a single test.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nThe king can assign each prisoner a binary number from 0 to 1011 (1023 in decimal), which is a 10-digit binary number. Each digit in the binary number corresponds to a bottle of wine. If the digit is 1, the prisoner drinks from the corresponding bottle. If the digit is 0, the prisoner does not drink from the corresponding bottle.\n\nAfter 24 hours, the king will know which prisoners are alive and which are dead. The binary numbers of the dead prisoners will tell the king exactly which bottles are poisoned. For example, if prisoners 0000000001 (1 in decimal) and 0000010001 (1025 in decimal) are dead, the king knows that bottles 1 and 10 are poisoned.\n\nThis method allows the king to test 1023 bottles with only 10 prisoners in 24 hours. Since the king has 1000 bottles, he can use this method to find the poisoned bottle.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"D\"}","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.
