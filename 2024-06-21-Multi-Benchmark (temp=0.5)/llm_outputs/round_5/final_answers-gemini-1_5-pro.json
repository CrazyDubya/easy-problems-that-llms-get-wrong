Using a binary search strategy with the 10 prisoners, leveraging the concept of binary numbers to minimize the number of tests needed. The king will know results in 24 hours\n\n    Provide an explanation for your thinking and then select a single choice from ANSWERS that answer the QUESTION. Return in JSON format, for example:\n    {\"ANSWER\": \"A\"}\n    ","correct_letter":"B","model_answer":"```json\n{\n\"ANSWER\": \"D\",\n\"EXPLANATION\": \"Here's why the answer is D and how it works:\n\n* **The Problem:**  Finding one poisoned bottle out of 1000 is a classic search problem.  We need to do it efficiently with the constraint of 24 hours.\n\n* **Why other options won't work:**\n    * **A:**  This is highly unethical and doesn't guarantee finding the bottle. What if multiple prisoners die?\n    * **B:** The poison only takes effect after 24 hours, so tasting bitterness won't help.\n    * **C:**  This is logistically impossible. Each prisoner would have to take 100 sips, leading to potential mixing and inaccurate results.\n\n* **Solution: Binary Search**\n\n    1. **Numbering:** Assign each prisoner a number from 1 to 10.  Think of these as places in a binary number (e.g., prisoner 1 is the 'ones' place, prisoner 2 is the 'twos' place, prisoner 3 is the 'fours' place, and so on).\n\n    2. **Labeling Wine:**  Number the wine bottles from 1 to 1000. Convert each bottle's number into its binary representation (e.g., bottle 5 is 101 in binary).\n\n    3. **Giving Wine:** For each bottle, a prisoner will take a small sip if their corresponding binary place value is a '1' in the bottle's binary representation.  \n        * Example: Bottle 5 (binary 101): Prisoners 1 and 3 would sip from this bottle.\n\n    4. **Observation:** After 24 hours, note which prisoners have died. The dead prisoners represent '1's in a binary number, and the living prisoners represent '0's. \n\n    5. **Decoding:** Construct a binary number based on the dead\/alive status of the prisoners. Convert this binary number back to decimal form \u2013 this will be the number of the poisoned bottle.\n\n* **Example:** If prisoners 1, 4, and 5 die, the binary number is 011001, which converts to decimal 57. Bottle 57 is poisoned.\n\n* **Efficiency:** Binary search is incredibly efficient. With 10 prisoners, you can test up to 2^10 (1024) bottles in a single round. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"18":{"category":"Linguistic","question":"Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.","human_answer":"Dogs bark with me.","correct_answer":"'Dogs bark with me.'","multiple_choice":["'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'","'Dogs bark with me.'","'The five boxers jog quick.'","No such sentence is possible."],"multi_choice_question":"QUESTION\n    Write a grammatically correct sentence without reusing any letter more than once.\n\n    ANSWERS\n    A.

Here's how to approach it:\n\n* **The Birthday Paradox:** The standard birthday problem highlights that you only need a surprisingly small group of people (23) to have a greater than 50% chance of two people sharing a birthday. This is because we're looking for any two people to match, not one specific birthday.\n\n* **Twins and the Problem:**  Each pair of twins guarantees a birthday match.  However, we still need to account for the possibility of twins sharing a birthday with someone who is not their twin.\n\n* **Finding the Threshold:**  While 1 pair of twins guarantees a match within that pair, it doesn't reach a 50% chance of any two people in the room sharing a birthday if we add more people who are not twins. As we increase the number of twin pairs, we increase the probability of a shared birthday with non-twins as well.  It turns out that around 23 pairs of twins will lead to a total number of people where the odds are similar to the classic birthday problem. \n\"\n}\n``` \n","score":""},"25":{"category":"Puzzle","question":"A partially full hotel has an infinite number of fully furnished rooms.
