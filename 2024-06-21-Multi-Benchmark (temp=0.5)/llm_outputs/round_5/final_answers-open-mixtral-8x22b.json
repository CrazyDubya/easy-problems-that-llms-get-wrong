The winner of Race 3 is the fastest horse overall.\n\nHowever, we still need to determine the second and third fastest horses.

This is because the switches and bulbs have a one-to-one relationship, meaning each switch controls only one bulb. By turning on one switch at a time, you can observe which bulb turns on and then turn off that switch before moving on to the next one. This way, you can accurately determine which switch controls which bulb.\n\nOption A is incorrect because you do not need to leave the room to observe the bulbs.

Since the walking speed is 3mph, we don't know the time it took to reach the friend's house, but we can use a variable to represent it. Let's call the time it took to walk to the friend's house as \"t\" hours. Therefore, the distance to the friend's house is 3t miles.\n\nThe goal is to double the average speed for the entire trip, which means the average speed should be 6mph. To find the total distance for the round trip, we can use the formula:\n\nTotal Distance = Average Speed \u00d7 Total Time\n\nSince the total time for the round trip is 2t (t hours to walk to the friend's house and t hours to run back), we can set up the equation:\n\n2 \u00d7 3t = 6 \u00d7 2t\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n6t = 12t\n\nThis equation doesn't make sense because the distance to the friend's house (3t) should not be equal to the total distance for the round trip (6t). However, we can still find the running speed needed to double the average speed.\n\nLet's call the running speed \"r\" mph. The time it takes to run back is t hours, so the distance for the running part is rt miles. The total distance for the round trip is now 3t + rt.\n\nUsing the average speed formula again:\n\nTotal Distance = Average Speed \u00d7 Total Time\n\n(3t + rt) = 6 \u00d7 2t\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n3t + rt = 12t\n\nSince we want to find the running speed \"r\", we can rearrange the equation to solve for \"r\":\n\nrt = 12t - 3t\nrt = 9t\n\nDividing both sides by t to solve for \"r\":\n\nr = 9\n\nTherefore, the running speed needed to double the average speed for the entire trip is 9mph.
