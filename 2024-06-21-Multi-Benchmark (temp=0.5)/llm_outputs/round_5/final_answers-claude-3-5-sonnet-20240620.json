The torch must be brought back by one person for the others to use.\n\nThe optimal strategy is to send the two fastest people (A and B) across first, then have the fastest (A) return with the torch. Then the two slowest (C and D) cross together, and the second fastest (B) returns with the torch. Finally, the two fastest (A and B) cross again.\n\nHere's how it would work:\n1. A and B cross: 2 minutes\n2. A returns: 1 minute\n3. C and D cross: 10 minutes\n4. B returns: 2 minutes\n5.

Let's say the distance to your friend's house is x miles.\n\n2. At 3 mph, the time to walk there is x\/3 hours.\n\n3. We want the average speed for the entire trip to be 6 mph (double the walking speed).\n\n4. For an average speed of 6 mph, the total time for the round trip should be 2x\/6 = x\/3 hours.\n\n5. But we've already spent x\/3 hours walking there. This means we have no time left for the return trip!\n\n6. No matter how fast we run back, we can't make the average speed for the entire trip exactly double the walking speed.\n\n7. We would need to run back instantaneously (infinitely fast) to achieve this.\n\nThis leads us to the conclusion that it's impossible to achieve exactly double the average speed for the entire trip by running back at any finite speed.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"ANSWER\": \"B\"}","score":""}}
